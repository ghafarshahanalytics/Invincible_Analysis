Review
"My favorite terrible review here is the guy complaining that this is a ripoff of ""the awsomes"" (his words not mine) from ""5 years ago"". Bro. The comic this is based on started in 2003."
"Invincible really increases the standards in animated tv or web series by showing good character development, emotion, great ton of action and pg-18 violence which is kinda cool. Best thing is, every episode is 40 minutes instead of 20 üò¨"
"I think I'm gonna like this show. Violent, irreverent, entertaining. Seems like it will be able to hit all the same marks as ""the boys"" but without budget limitations. Which is awesome. And the star power of this show is incredible. Seriously look at that cast list. I'll definitely be eagerly awaiting new episodes."
I have no clue of the source material but happy they kept it animated. Not what I was expecting but epsidoe had me hooked!
"I watched the first episode and after the ending i just had to binge watch the next two. It was just as mindblowing as when i first read the Omniman arc.I don't know why people are so mad that there's gore in this show. I mean, it's not for kids, the story is mature and trust me, if there were superheroes and supervillains in real life, the gory deaths would be an everyday thing. I have read all the comic book series and for the people that thinks everything is predictable i just have to say that they're right... and they're totally wrong as well. Just keep watching.The plot is well written, characters are credible, voice acting is good, animation is not perfect but not bad either. I'm getting hyped with every episode and i just can't wait to things that will come next. Mindblowing will be a recurring word as you watch this show."
"So far, Invincible has been everything I expected and more. I never read the comics so I was exactly sure what to expect but from reading up on it and watching the trailer I knew it's the type of show I usually like so I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm glad I did bc so far it's pretty good! The voice over cast has to be one of, if not the best, of any series ever! It almost has the star power of a animated movie."
"At last! (as one user pointed out too), an adult animation action series, encompassing full-length episodes with gut-wrenching animations, splashing blood & brain 360¬∞ and having you thinking about no other production but Invincible, till the last episode has been watched and finished!The last two episodes are the most memorable ones with Crazy Everything.. Till the next greater attack..Kudos! Robert Kirkman, you showed that your talent for serious animation script is way bigger than your FTWD camera-wielding beauty ""zombies"".Screenplay/story: 8.5Development: 9.5Realism: 9.5Entertainment: 9.5Cast: 8.5Animation: 9.5Music/score: 9Depth: 9Logic: 8Flow: 9.5Action/suspense: 9.5Ending: 7.5."
"Season 1 of this knocked it out of the park. The animation wasn't top tier, but everything else felt fresh even if it was a bit of the same. There was an energy in season 1 that radiated off of the screen in every way. Season 2, on the other hand, is proving to be a bit of a chore to get through. The stiffness of the animation's really taking its toll, and there is an air of something missing. The voice acting is definitely carrying the show, and while I don't hate it, I no longer love it. I'll check into the show here & there, but I think I'm going to reread the comic a third time to scratch that Invincible itch."
"I rated Season One 9/10, but Season Two was a huge disappointment. As a Robert Kirkland fan and an adamant reader of the comic book I felt Season Two has gone way too far from the source material. The storytelling and plot has become too convoluted and burdened down by whiny teenage emotional drama. Furthermore, it was bad enough that this season is basically a soap opera, but many episodes also turn into therapy sessions often with characters sobbing in tears. Maybe I'm old school but superheroes crying every episode does not feel very super. Lastly, three major storytelling tropes that I highly dislike are multidimensional portals, time travel paradoxes and numerous fake deaths put them together in one season and we all just wasted hours of our lives because each of these tropes fixes everything and anything. These plot escape holes have become redundant, frustrating and annoying. Usually, using tropes in this manner means lazy writing and a cash grab, thusly I'm done with Invincible."
"Prime Video's (and Robert Kirkman's) Invincible adds another interesting take to the popular superhero genre. Filling the void of The Boys this year, Invincible is: mature, action-packed, visually stunning, charmingly written, perfectly acted, and so much more. I admittedly haven't read the comics but I was always aware of them and from my understanding, the show so far is staying true to the source material which is amazing. I love the world the creators setup, the heroes are oddly familiar in terms of looks and powers yet they are strangely different at times. It's extremely reminiscent of The Boys in that sense. The characters are heroic, funny, and transparent with one another (for the most part) similar to the Justice League animated series. While Invincible contains some superhero tropes, it's done on purpose and there's always something interesting happening thanks to the strong writing and perfect cast. I cannot wait to see what happens next. Suffice to say it'll be very hard for me to wait so I may just read the comics too!"
"This show reallyyy doesn't hold back. Atleast a few times an episode my jaw dops.. especially episode 8.... 10/10 This is it's own thing, Setting the bar insanely high üëè"
"Mind blowing epic series that gets exceedingly better as it goes on! It's great that Robert Kirkman is involved he's perfect at sticking to the comics. I love the adult vibes, character development is spot on, color design is really nice, and the exciting feelings you'd get because it's about super heroes that kick ass."
"There is no way you see this series and not loving it if you like superheroes. Well writen, great villan, amazing characters. BUT there is one character that basiclly screw a perfect series, Amber the love interest. No character arc, no flaws, and if you havent seen the show you will get to see a gigantic hole in her logic near the end of the series. It would not matter if it was a minor character or a small insignificant moment but this is one of the ""pilars"" of the series."
Trashes traditional comic plot arcs and takes you on a wild ride.
People sayin this is a revolutionary and unique superhero show are straight trippin. One of the most generic superhero stories in recent memory aside from the gorieness. Omni-man and invincible carry the show but just about every other character is completely uninteresting. The season could have been shortened to 4 or 5 episodes and been better for it.
"TL;DR: Season 1: alright, Season 2: boring, Overall: plot armor everywhereSeason 1:
A good first watch, but hard to get through on a revisit. So much of the plot gets held up by uninteresting drama and inconsequential action. Barely anything of consequence happens outside the first and last episodes. The dialogue is often cringe.Season 2:
Far less interesting than season 1. It's practically all setup and no payoff. Aside from episode 4, nothing with any real stakes happens. I enjoyed seeing the Guardians valiantly lose that fight but by the end of the season, none of them were actually dead. It's laughable this show parades around with it's excessive violence and gore yet no one main or side character ever dies or ends up deformed.Overall:
Maybe it's a by product of the source material, but this safety net, where every character with a first name has plot armor, deflates any tension I once felt for this show and its universe."
"Hurry up and make more episodes, it is a great show."
"A flawless piece of animated entertainment. The final was brutal to the point of breaking me, and the journey was worth every second. Truly amazing."
"After finishing EP5 I have to say perfect animation, story development and overall superb timing to the twist and turns of the unexpected. I'm 42 years old and loving every minute of this show with my son of 18 years of age. Freaking awesome!Amazon Original making a stand with the rest. 10/10 üåü"
After the ending of the first episode I knew this show was going to be great.Can't wait until season 2 and 3!
"I hope to provide an interesting perspective. My intention was never to watch this show on my own, I don't particularly like to take in every bit of superhero media. Due to having a partner who consumes a LOT of superhero media (MCU, DC comics, all that jazz), I was presented with a question I feel many of you may have presented to a partner, or even have been presented with: ""Do you wanna watch Invincible with me?"" Honestly, I'm typically willing to give most things a shot, and the combination of star-studded voice acting and clean animation made me agreeable. When I say that it is one of my favorite superhero shows, it's really only going up against The Boys, so that's a tough competition for top-spot. I will say, after being encouraged to fully read the comics, it has taken away excitement that I had for future seasons. It feels too spoiled to enjoy unfortunately. I'm sure it'll be fantastic, but maybe just don't read the comics first unless you're cool with that sort of thing."
Honestly I was kinda put off when I saw the episodes were 45-min long.Then I watched it.Every episode flew by completely and right now I'm in desperate need for more.
I did not know anything about the comics. The first episode shocked me so hard I am still not ready to continue. No words.Don't watch this with children!
"The first episode and the last two are really the only ones that are any good, the other five episodes are either uninteresting or just outright boring. Most of the characters aren't interesting, the romance is lame, there was no humor whatsoever either. It starts exciting then becomes boring real quick and finishes pretty good, not much better than that."
"This is an EXCELLENT superhero series. It's possible in the future that I might actually like it more than Amazon Prime's ""The BOYS"". The idea of an ""Anti-Superman"" really does make a killer plot, literally. Great job to everyone involved. Really looking forward to future episodes."
First off I LOVE the invincible comics so I was so relieved that they were making an animated show. I wanted them to be able to capture the shock and awe like the comics and they DO. The blood and guts is beautifully animated and the voice actors all do amazing. The first episode ends with easily the best scene in the entire show that sets the pace for the whole season. Watching the hero fight and learn throughout the show is a pleasure. Seriously new super heroes wouldn't win every fight and this show captures that realism very well. Overall couldn't have asked for a better representation of one of my favorite comic series! I can't wait for more seasons!
This show is great. It keeps me wanting to see more of the show and how it develops. The cast is great and voice acting is very good. Especially omni man has the perfect voice for this character. For those people that rate it one star because of all the gore and blood. There is a show called Pokemon that will suit you better. Go watch that.
"I know - another superhero show - the last thing we need. But this is one of the best animated shows I have ever seen and it features some pretty incredible action sequences, stellar animation, great characters/voice acting and a fantastic story with lots of twists and turns. It has some seriously jaw dropping moments. Can't wait for the next season and I may have to read the source material."
Invincible is the greatest superhero show I have seen today and gets better each time I watch it. Invincible has a great Villain and characters which are well written. Season 1 was the perfect season but has some minor flaws(episode 4 and 6).Season 2 is a great beginning and the storyline keeps getting better but not much omniman. I started the show last year when Season 2 episode 4 released and binged it on December 24th 2023 instead of going to sleep. The show was able to make me read the comics and the show is a little different than the comics. So overall Invincible is the 10/10 superhero show.
"Although at the beginning it might seem like a more polished 80 superhero cartoon, it's anything but.My TLDR is that the positives of this show significantly outweigh any flaws.The nits first:
The plot pacing is a bit uneven at times. More specifically, some of the character development happens in too short of span to be comfortably accepted as natural.Which brings us to the show's biggest strength: The characters are genuinely likable (and dislikable where appropriate) and believable as personalities. The subtle comics and pop culture references are fun, too."
"I wish I could give this show an 8 out of 10, but the characters lack depth, they exist; yet we don't feel any fondness for them nor connection to them. Omni-man is the only interesting character, imo. The rest are bland and/or annoying. Especially Mark, he really gets on my nerves. Other than the issue with how the characters are written, how basic their personalities are, their lack of development and backstory; this show still holds its own. It's definitely worth watching, it's definitely GOOD, but it is still missing important marks. I hope that season two fills the voids that were in season one and gives this show a fuller and more fleshed out universe. 7/10 show, 10/10 gore- (Finally, superheroes are doing the damage that they should be doing, wonderful job, animators.)"
"This is just a regular show, it really isn't anything special, you've seen all of this before, all of the characters have little depth (except Omni-man) and you've seen all of these situations before. Again, I like this show, it's just nothing outstanding or creative. The last two episodes were pretty good but the rest was, ehhhh, like I said, there is NOTHING new here and that is really disappointing."
"When ""Invisible"" debuted on Prime Video, it stood out as a remarkable series, in my opinion, surpassing many Marvel movies and animations in terms of quality and storytelling. However, despite its potential, Amazon Prime initially underrated the show. It wasn't until the release of season two that the show gained significant traction and a dedicated fanbase, surprising both the platform and viewers alike with its popularity.The voice overs in ""Invisible"" are exceptionally well-done, adding depth and immersion to the storyline. The narrative itself is captivating, making each episode a compelling watch that I find myself revisiting multiple times.Looking ahead, I eagerly anticipate the release of season three and hope that the creators continue to build upon the show's strengths without deviating from its core essence, unless such changes contribute to an even more compelling storyline."
Here is my review this is superb masterpiece starting of firts episode totally mindblowing.
"Absolutely Brilliant. This is the BEST Superhero comic book movie series this is out there right now,I can't wait to more of the upcoming series."
Amazing series!! Happy to know that it has been renewed for seasons 2 & 3.
I like the title card its very funny because it just cuts off what the character is saying which is funny. Very cool writing and animation and voice acting.
"Its a very good show. I'm not saying its not good, its very good. The voice acting and the voice cast is outstanding. The animation is brilliant. The story however, while it shows heaps of promise as it stands right now, it did retread a lot of ground already covered by other things. That's the problem with adapting anything predating the super hero boom following Iron Man - what was subversive in 2003 isn't very subversive in 2021. I'm very excited to see how things happen going forward, in future I'd like to see them stick a little less strictly to the source material and embody more of the spirit of invincible, be subversive. If, as i'm hoping, they're playing the long can and will turn things on their head as it goes on I will MORE than happily eat my words. Until then, I'm sticking with my 7 out of 10 - a score I would LOVE to improve in the future."
"A mix between ""The Boys"" (18+) and DC's animated series ""The Justice League"" (PG-13).But to be really good the series should know where it's headed.It's not as violent and nasty as ""The Boys"" but also not as vanilla and family friendly as ""The Justice League"".Sometimes the two styles just don't work very well together.But it's a promising and fun show to watch."
"Most likely the best animated show I have ever seen so far, from the shock of the first episode to the insane reveals at the end it just kept me hooked. Even though the animation is a bit lazy in episode 6 (the worst one), the fight scenes are immaculate and would work how an actual fight would work if you could punch like Superman. Even though I really enjoy The Boys I feel that Invincible is the better show, I love how it has so much to show you but just gives you enough so that you're not overwhelmed. There's definitely more stuff going on in the universe can't wait for season 2."
"To be a superhero adult-animation series, it would follow the norms of displaying the power ranks between the characters and establishing a cliche back story for the protagonist but invincible looks the other way entirely. From the first minutes of the show, the trials and tribulations of the characters are shown and world they live in as they know it transforms around each decision made by each one the them.Obviously before chaos ensues in the midst, it creates an ever-wanting feeling to binge the next episode and the one after that to continue in the world the characters live in and in the events they go through. The cast being phenomenal with amazing voice acting from each one of them and the scriptwriting just astounding makes the show a must watch for anyone; Especially the superhero junkies."
What an awesome animated series..Just nd strt watching.
"Normally I hate super hero shows and movies, but this show really did it right. It took the core idea of superhero content, but turned it into a (mostly) mature show, that didn't make superhero characters parodies of themselves, like some brands (Marvel). Storyline was really engaging, voice acting was great, and the animation was great. I probably would have given this a nine if Amber wasn't the most unfathomably unbased character to ever exist in a tv series or movie. My only other critique was that I don't really like the high school part of the show. It's not bad, but the Omni-Man and GDA plots are a lot more interesting."
"Such a good show. At the first glance invincible looks like a typical superhero story for children/ young teens. But the viewer will quickly realise how ""deep"" and dark the show is. Don't let the cartoon style distract you from the fact that this show tackles difficult issues very well and portrays superheros realistically. It is best compared to Watchmen or The Boys. Invincible scores with clever writing and very good animation."
"Overall, if you really enjoy this you should just read the comic as it is significantly better than the show.So the show is good in terms of staying mostly true to the comic. The problem is that the pacing is completely screwed up, where it starts to get really bad in season 2 as well as the animation quality being subpar (the comic does an amazing job at depicting action scenes). I understand it is probably extremely difficult to fit everything nicely so it makes sense, but towards the end of season 2 there was so much filler and nonsense when they should have been focusing on major plot points from the comics. Another gripe I have is the situation between Mark and Anissa, which means Marky doesn't exist anymore? They pussied out of some major character developments that have interesting resolutions later on in the story."
"I have no idea why this show is as lauded as it is. The characters are all dull (especially Mark), with the exception of Omni-Man, and that too, really only because of JK Simmons' voice acting. The subplot about Mark trying and failing to balance his personal life with his superhero job was tired and unoriginal (just watch Spider-Man 2). Besides the gore, which is admittedly a lot of fun, I don't understand why this is being praised so much. This was just boring garbage, I don't know what else to call it. Is the concept of evil Superman, played out for the 1000th time now, that interesting?"
"I LOVED the show, no doubt. Going to be honest, I really liked Nolan/Omni-Man. I've always loved the characters that were super torn on what they were doing. Nolan managed to hit the spot. Not to mention it's JK Simmons, I mean come on. He's probably one of the coolest actors out there at the moment, and nobody can change my mind."
"I had episode 1 spoiled for me, but the conclusion was still a shock (and I still had no idea why it had happened). Learning over the course of the season was an experience. I do like how people figured it out over time, because it wasn't exactly a masterful plan in terms of keeping the culprit a secret.Regarding the rest of the story, the characters all felt real and relatable (even Amber, who was a bit preachy at times). The high school drama stuff wasn't to my taste but that shows my age rather than the quality of the storytelling. The heroes were cool, the villains were cool, the demon detective was cool, and the sinking feeling once it all came into the open was well done.Finally, looks like they pinched Grog from Legend of Vox Machina as the blue hulk twins, which cracked me up."
"Most people praise anime because ""IT'S ANIME."" But let's praise a god-tier show like this made by Americans. This is seriously so good. Most people that I have go to watch this show I have to tell them to continue watching the first episode because it seems like it ends but it really doesn't. That is where everyone gets so hooked on this show.If any of the writers or voice actors read this just know this is perfect and I can't wait for more. This is one of the best cartoons of all-time in my opinion. I also got the books just to spoil everything for myself but they are slightly different anyway.I am impatiently waiting for season 2 to drop."
"I am patiently waiting for the next part of the second season of this serial animation and I can say that this animation is so different, even if this series is broadcast in one week with the Marvel series, it is still an unbeatable animation for you It will be more pleasant and different
I'd love to see it go according to the comics and see a parallel universe version of Invincible and Spider-Man coming to his rescue and I hope that happens
I am very satisfied with the character in the animation and I am very happy that the doubler of this serial animation is used by famous Hollywood actors and it gives a special feeling."
"I don't usually watch animated shows but I kept seeing stuff about it, eventually I gave in and wow, it is amazing. It's rare that a show is this good, at first I didn't realise what the fuss was about, it just seemed like a standard kid friendly animated superhero show with a couple of swear words thrown in, but wow, the last 10 minutes of the first episode changed everything, I was hooked from that moment. 10/10."
When tf season 2 coming out bro. A really good show but come on it's almost been two years PRIME release season two of this and season four of the boys.
"For all fans of Robert Kirkman's comic book series, Invincible lives up to my expectations to watch character development, emotion, all the action, voice casting, and tons of violence!Just watched the first 3 episodes and they were outstanding."
"This show has quite strong season 01 where you can enjoy many segments about being super hero, which are rotten by some weird choices of teenage drama and have no place in show like this, but you can forgive it.. a little. Then comes season 02 which is all teenage drama but 2 ep's are somehow good, so decline is here, not shocked really, expected failure by looking at season 01 sample. Basically if season 03 comes out, you can skip s02 you won't miss anything, since Mark is crying and moping whole season - yep that's what I want to watch in my free time, super hero having existential teenage drama getting beaten every episode and nagging gf. Go go writers."
"Every complaint I had with the overrated show ""The Boys,"" this show solves it. Invincible has heart, well choreographed fight scenes, and a believable world popping right out of the comic pages."
"I'm really glad Amazon decided to go with the animation route because if it was live action there would no doubt be alot of changes to the story. Though there are changes events are moved around and some are expanded upon but it's still the story done right. Amazon's other comic based show The Boys while is a good show on it's own is almost nothing like the comic just the character names and the basic story of supers being a bunch of Aholes and that's it. They got quite the list of actors to do this show and they all do a great job. I'm also glad they PG this series and tone down the violence because the comic did get very bloody and brutal at times in fact they made it more R rated by adding some cursing that wasnt in the comic, this show is most definitely not for children. I'm looking forward to the rest of the season and I hope they make more of it."
"Dude, I haven't seen a pilot that good since Game of Thrones a couple years ago. Netflix beware, Amazon Prime is coming!"
"A great adaptation of Kirkman's comic, which, like the Walking Dead - he ended. Probably because he ran out of ideas - how often can the main hero be beaten nearly to death and recover? Well, that's that. Honestly, I like the show even more than the comic. Kirkman is a bit verbose and tends to cram a lot of words into panels. The animated show avoids that while keeping the story pretty intact. The voice cast (several from The Walking Dead and Killing Eve, as well as the absolutely phenomenal 'Does he Ever Rest?"" J. K. Simmons) are superb. The action is NOT FOR THE KIDDIES. This is not your daddy's superhero show. I'm really hoping amazon gives it a full run to finish the entire story. This makes up for their atrocious adaptation of Without Remorse."
"One of the best shows I have ever seen. It has so much more depth than I thought a cartoon about Superheroes good, however, it's very allegorical. The show is a metaphor for deeper issues surrounding identity, race, gender, perception, and et cetera. The voice acting is perfect. The pacing is perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect."
"Every episode just gets better and better. Most of Invincible is about why Nolan killed the Guardians, and when it all makes sense, the show gets insanely good. There's so much lore that's left to be expanded on, like Viltrum and the Coalition of Planets. Season 1 is just near perfect. It not only setup season 2 perfectly, but it also has great voice acting from a talented cast, smart and likable characters, and a super creative story. The only issue is that the animation is a little weak; at times it's very noticeably bad too. Invincible is just such a great show, and honestly, it's the best thing on Prime Video. I have high hopes for the future seasons, and if they're as good as the first season, then Invincible could be one of, if not the best animated show of all time."
"Everything feels like separate entities. The score, the voice acting, the animation, the story; it's all a b-class mess. Never heard of the comic, so I'm objectively reviewing it as a show. Way overhyped and overrated."
"Genuinely a very good show that I would heavily recommend to anyone that I know. It's such a well written show and you can enjoy it, wether you read the comics or not. The characters are great and are all likeable in their own ways. Everything about this show has been done amazingly and I can't think of anything I would want to change about it. The animation is great, the voice acting is great and the actions amazing too. As I said, everything this show could have done right, it did. Thoroughly enjoyed watching this show and am patiently waiting for a second season. By far the best superhero show I've ever watched."
"If you never seen that yet, leave everything and just watch every episode today. Actor are jist awesome... J. K. Simons... And others -, _-, I CAN WAIT FOR ANOTHER SEASON NEXT FEW MONTHS AAAAAAA."
"It's just perfect . I mean the animation was a bit odd but voice acting, characters, storytelling was absolutely a master piece. I like all the characters except amber . She belongs to the street . Omni man aka j.k simmons was the best character. If they fix the animation and amber it will be one of the greatest show. This show made me care for mark and every character and all the people . I thought it will be like every other superhero movie but at the end of s1 e1 I couldn't have been more wrong . I think this show will always be my personal favorite. I am begging for new season to release ."
"I have been super hero genre buff my entire life, but this show's portrayal of young hero in his early years of power explore new dimensions which I have never seen in any show or movie. The small details like when the father Son duo practice flight, landing and maneuvering in the air brings unique excitement and a grounded approach.The animation style is superb. I love violence, blood gore so yeah! Its for me. The voice acting is top-notch.A must watch for the boys fan."
"Probably one of the best debut seasons ever so far. Cast, animation, story, everything was amazing from start to finish and elevated on an epic level.Especially, in the season finale. Among all that gore, action and tragedy it was a clash of wills ended with a victory of love and endurance of a son.Throughout the series Mark's superhero name was told to be optimistic but we have seen that even in his last breath he was standing for what he was believing. That's what makes him Invincible.Lastly, the other side of the coin, Nolan Grayson. The series gave the impression of how he has a dilemma within inside, between his origin and later thought humanity. He faced his own demon hopefully one last time to become what he means to become within eyes of Mark and Debbie.I have been waiting on the series for so long thanks to amazing cast. Hype was real. One of the best experiences I've had. And, it is just the beginning..."
"Im not really familiarized with the source material, but for me it just feels like a kids cartoon but with gore, which just feels odd, most of the time I just found myself being bored with the cliche tropes, im guessing that was the point, but that doesnt mean that is less boring, action scenes are pretty good and the animation is nice, but aside from that, is just ok, for the time being at least."
"Sigh what a crap, dull, boring, go nowhere nonsense episode/season. With all the blood and gore you'd think this show would be cool but instead you get 90% of the runtime with people having feelings, talking about their feelings, talking about how they talked about their feelings.,,, seriously who is rhe target audience? 15 year old girls? And all the soul searching Urgh boring! No one wants to see the hero sulking around hoir after hour whilst fully saying ""who am I"" every 5 minutes. And what awful girlfriend of his- what a horrible abusing person. Glad she's gone: and everyone keeps ""dying"" oh but then they are fine.... The season was a MASSIVE downgrade and dull as dishwater."
So good it leads to so many questions. A dark story to a super franchise. I feel like I can't say hero because it really feels like that line is nonexistent in this. Who is the hero for now? What really makes a villan?
It's one of the best animated shows I have ever seen. Keep going I want more!
"I want to be more invested and really love this. There are parts that are just... unbelievable in a good way. The dialog and jokes are amazing. The problem for me is that the irreverence makes it difficult to be invested in when it's serious. It's not a juxtaposition that works for me, and comes off as way more of a comedy than a serious drama or epic. Or maybe it's that the big looming threat to the series seems to... well really not be much of a threat since you know it's resolved somehow and everything between then has no real stakes. So many of the characters are jokes themselves, so I don't care about if they die except for William."
A perfect comic book adaptation indeed. It's amazing in every sense.
"This show is incredible for kids to learn about what being a hero is, especially episode 8 of season 1! You should totally just blindly put it on for your kids and walk away, it'll only help them learn about life. Incredible show, my favorite cartoon ever."
"Golly. What a show. Don't watch if you hate gore. It's pretty bad and worse than Squid Game. Otherwise, there are few shows that I would recommend more than this one (at least season one).In many ways it's a cliche superhero show but things have been added to turn an original idea into a fresh new one. The most obvious one is probably how violent and gory it is. I can enjoy superhero content without this stuff, but to present it in this way demonstrates the stakes that are at play, and the consequences that superheroes have to deal with. Are the benefits worth the cost? You can't turn back time and undo mistakes to big bad choices. And all the while our main character continues to grow and all the side characters have their own struggles to overcome. To be honest, I wasn't thrown off by Amber as much as other people were. The fight in episode 8 is really well done and presents a rollercoaster of emotions (again, only for those who can really take on gore on another level).For those who are wondering, yes, the story in the comics is still very strong after the first season and I'm really excited to see the next seasons. It'll be interesting to see if it adapts as well as the first season did.I can find so few weaknesses with this show I had to look at 1-star reviews and see what people had to say. Here are my responses:1* ""The show is just another sad attempt to get viewers by shocking them with pointless violence. It just shows a lack of creativity or originality. Waste of time.""A: I say the exact opposite. The violence is different from other superhero stories in that it shows the consequences of people's actions. The villains in this story are pretty heartless and it shows. Very few superhero content dare to mimic a fraction of this. Before you say the Boys did it first, the comic began in 2003, whereas the Boys began in 2006. It's part of the 'humanity' message to Omni-Man. Even if it's just a small thing, we congratulate those who succeed, boo those who fail, hate those who oppress and love those who care. The added violence helps us empathize more with the characters, both the heroes and the villains.1* ""You will be bored out of your brains watching this. Obvious, corny and violent for no reason. Give it a miss and enjoy life. Or better still get a compendium of early Marvel classics and read those.""A: I can think of nothing that screams 'bored out of my brain' in this show. This implies the show has no emotion. Even if you hate gore in your show and you didn't like it for that reason, it's at the least disgusting, but not boring. It's a show that's being bold for what it is, and some people admire it while others are not a fan. And I have read some Marvel classics that are good but I didn't give this a miss and I still enjoy life.1* ""Seems that to get a good rating, cartoons need to be full of blood, like, above the storyline, it's ok to show brains all over.""A: The Incredibles, Spider-verse movies, Big Hero 6, Megamind. Four examples of pretty good animated superhero movies that have little to no blood that are all fairly recent. I don't give a show 10* because of blood; literally nobody rates a show for that reason. You don't have to like the gore, that's fine. The characters, plot and themes are what won me over.1* ""The animation was super cheap, like, worse than scooby doo.""A: I prefer cheap good animation to expensive bad animation. The budget for each 40-minute episode was $10 million, while the average budget for each 40-minute episode of a Marvel show is $25 million. I'm not saying the Marvel animators don't do their best but it just is not as articulate or expressive as a show like this. The animation style is great in my opinion because it matches the comic book style. Like, you could pause at any point in the show and see that exact image as a potential slide in the comic book itself, whereas I just don't get that feeling watching a Marvel show. Call it cheap if you like but it works.1* ""Got through 15 minutes and didn't want to watch any more""
1* ""I'm 15 minutes into episode one...and I've already had enough!""
1* ""Maybe if this was at a normal length for a show like this (which is typically 20 minutes, 25 at most), I would come to enjoy this. But at this point, I can't.""A: Imagine giving the ENTIRE show one star because you only watched a tiny portion of it and found it uninteresting. Anybody who has seen the entire show understands how horrible of an argument this is.Season 2 Update (spoilers): Season 2 was a very fun experience overall. A very slow start to what otherwise is a good season 2, making sure to keep stakes high and originality. Season 1 has the advantage of kind of keeping a self-contained arc (by that I mean the story focuses on Omni-Man and that minor element gets resolved at least partly by the end of the season). Season 2 does have that ""middle chapter"" feel to it. There is a story in it with Angstrom Levy but he only really shows up in the beginning and end and nowhere in the middle. I'm glad they kept some real consequences in the story, which is something I thought stood out a lot in Season 1. Rexplode has a good arc after the fight with the Lizard League and one character was portrayed to have actually died. Robert Kirk has generally done a good job with stuff like this in this comic as well as the Walking Dead. Amber and Mark breaking up was actually very well done in my opinion. A couple of moments seemed to have cheap resolutions but most of the action was very well done overall. The complaints I'm listing haven't ruined my overall experience of the show, but this is the stuff that seperates the Bs from the As, and the great shows from the amazing shows. My rating has dropped to a 9 from season 2 but season 1 is still a masterpiece. Still a great season that is slow up to episode 2 but once you get to episode 3 gets backs to its prime."
"Your super cool series that I can recommend to everyone and that does a lot of things right, above all turning the superhero genre upside down or at least reshuffling the cards, I'll just list the things that the series does wrong.1. Time flies on the show I never noticed it, if it wasn't said all the time I wouldn't have guessed that the first season was within a year because you have absolutely no sense of time here with all the hospital stays and how the characters develop, if you had asked me, I would have assumed from the beginning that it would take a maximum of two months.2. Amber is an unlikable character who I absolutely disliked from the middle of the series and every scene with her got on my nerves terribly. I even wished at times that she would be written out of the series entirely or just die.3. I bought the comics, although the original template doesn't play a role purely for this review, but I noticed that basically they both do the same thing, I find Amber implemented much better in the comic and a lot more likeable than I do here in the series.4. The drawing style is a bit strange it just seems like some Saturday morning cartoon from the start
5. The computer generated graphics stand out and don't blend in well with the backgrounds
6. The explosions are clearly digital, which I don't think is a bad thing, but when even the backgrounds are so digital, especially during the flight scenes, I always scratch my head
7. Mark's racing animation is the last one so that's the only thing in the series that really looks bad from start to finish
8. The music is hit and miss the parts songs and generally the background music is really like a coin toss.9. The only tension in the series is the mystery of Omniman. What you only find out in the last episode and then the secret isn't even such a huge deal, at least not the revelation strong enough to justify waiting eight episodes.10. The love stories in all my films and series have never interested me and the comics are the same here in invincible it was the same again that didn't bother me from the start I was glad that Mark found a girlfriend but it worked for me from the beginning just like the annoying girlfriend who nags every now and then and in the end you will still tell her that she is a superhero from the beginning and that her actions and statements are even more superfluous."
"A 13-year-old's concept of 'dark'. The whole thing seems like it was dreamt up by Beavis and Butthead, like: ""and then his head explodes, like there's blood everywhere and it's all dripping down his face and there's bits of brain everywhere and it's really sick, dude"". Grow up. I love a bit of beautifully choreographed violence, but this is just childish and pathetic. Most of all it's simply boring and unoriginal, with episodic plot lines which are straight out of Justice League (as are most of the characters), and tedious teenage romance filling the gaps, badly scripted and poorly animated. Watched the whole season because the reviews said I should, but it was an absolute waste."
Fans of the comic will love it. Minor changes to keep everyone on their toes. ITS SOOOOO GOOD!!
This show is a tier above the best DC animation. It's funny and tragic. Its characters have an easy chemistry and it's brutality is hard to watch at times. Cannot recommend highly enough.
"At first without knowing anything about it I was like oh a super heroes knockoff. Whelp I was wrong I love the animation and cgi. I feel like I'm watching the old superman and batman cartoon from the 90s, with a little dragon ball z effects. There are parts that are very graphic which is a nice change up to the typical hero stuff. The story is good and has good plot. Over all I am actually looking forward for the next episode."
"Its like an other R rated show written by Martin, but We have to take our hats off for the creator it is a really original Comic very well written and created , And at the end of Episode one I jumped out of my Chair it was very graphic , Welldone great job!!!!"
"This isn't just a superheroe show. It goes way beyond that. I don't want to spoil any part of it, just make sure to watch the entire first episode."
"An amazing voyage through the the movie industry new MEGEA FRANCHISE, Superheros + Superheros Team Up + Incredible Writing x Amazing Cast/Voice Overs = HUGE, LONG TERM SUPERHEROS FRANCHISE that understands Genre Fans!!!"
"This was an Invincible relief for someone who has read the comics and really .. I mean really enjoyed them! I understand.adaptations hardly ever meet ""MY"" required expectations. But Invincible was different! It gave me exactly what I wanted."
"The ""invincible"" superhero is beaten to near death in every episode. The story is not captivating enough. Animation is good. Dialogues are okay. Nothing so special. I really don't get why this hyped so much. It's just a children's cartoon with extra violence and gore. My."
"Three episodes in and I'm totally hooked. If you watch the first episode until the end, I guarantee that you will also be addicted to this show. Beautifully done, tremendous story with a perfect pace and fantastic characters."
"I am really enjoying every bit of Invincible! The storyline, the cast, the artwork, all of it is top rate. I hope this show has many more season!I am Invincible!!!"
"If you are a fan of Kirkman's work then this will make you very happy! If you only know Walking Dead, then get ready for something fresh & completely different. Loved it!"
"My score would have been higher if not all the drama. The animation is excellent adaptation of an amazing comics. The story is excellent and I get the feeling it's similar to the Boys series. Amazon Prime Video is so much better in shooting series than Netflix, it feels it's on another level. It feels as there is too much unnecessary drama in the whole teenager department. Dealing with his father. Also there is a whole ""woke"" message creeping through, which annoys and ruins everything there is. The creators tried to keep it at minimum, but it still there. Remove the drama, remove the ""woke"", and it's a perfect 10/10 animation."
"I was not sure about this at first but I was hooked almost immediately. The animation is perfect, the pacing is perfect, the voice acting is great, the music is a treat. I love how they put the camera in the perfect position without doing flips or spinning from a cieling fan. Thank God this is no Michael Bay movie. Everything us so subtle. I love the character building. In just three episodes, each character grew; whether it was for the better, or for the worse, they grew. I'm so excited to see where it goes next!!"
One of the best shows I have watched in a long time. Can't imagine anyone watching this and not being absolutely enthralled in it and loving it. Season 2 cannot come soon enough!
"...(besides ATLA which I loved, but could never get myself to try anything else), but I just finished the first episode and I can see what makes it so popular. I have never read a single comic either but I'll probably check it out shortly lol. That is all."
"I didn't know a thing about this show, fell in love from the first episode, just Amazing.Can't wait for season 2."
"Loved season 1 and was excited for season 2 but I was left disappointed. I loved parts of the story: anything with the guardians, anything with Alan, the relationships but I just do not like the multiverse and Angstrom storyline and to be honest I found it a tad dull. To be fair I do not normally like multiverse stories so that is a factor. I do not think the quality has changed I just think I am not feeling the story they are telling. I also think the chosen release method of two parts with a gap in the middle did not work for me or help the story. I would have preferred week to week release. I hope the focus for the third season is on the aspects of the show I love and we can get back to the brilliance of season 1."
"Am I missing something here? How is this show being praised? I'll admit the cast is top notch and it's visually a cool looking show but jeez it's boring, I couldn't enjoy any character because they all were dull (besides the two blue clones) and the story line kept jumping with huge plot holes all around. The only thing that made me continue is this cliffhanger with Omni-Man, but besides that I would have stopped on episode 2. Just chop the dialogue in half and add in more fight scenes. That really was the best part."
AMAZING! The story so! Good. The voices so good. The choice of music üëå. You get hook on the 1st episode. Can't wait for season 2.
"Somehow, despite all odds, Invincible manages to use old plot devices and cliches from old superhero media and transform it into one of the best shows of the year."
The concept of bad superhero definitely comes from The Boys but Invincible surpasses it in every aspect. Screenplay of this series is so well written that it binds you to your chair. Last scene of every episode is a cliffhanger. You cannot resist yourself for binging the next episode.
"This show is just simply perfect. The animation is beautiful, the soundtrack is unique, very good song choice. The characters are relatable, fun, and interesting. The voice acting is a masterclass, simply nothing less. The choreography and fight sequences is super entertaining and beautiful. Finally, the story is amazing. They follow closely to the source material (the comic books) and as a comic book lover myself, it warmed my heart. The story is thrilling and I cannot wait for more episodes to be released for everyone to enjoy. I would do anything to watch it for the first time again. I would riot if this series was ever cancelled too soon."
"I never read the comics, I actually never heard of Invincible until I saw it here on IMDb. I watched the trailer, and I had a sense of ""The Boys"", a show a really enjoyed, so I tried it. And let me say, I fell in love right away. I think the only characters that were not-so unique were the original Guardians of the Globe. And that's not even a bad thing to me. When Mark finds out the truth about his dad, I really believe that it symbolizes some things in real life, how our parents keep secrets from us too. Not in that way, though (thank god). The best scene for me is when Nolan holds Mark in front of the train, killing the people instantly. It shows how far Nolan is willing to go to force his son to join Viltrum. Also, the show does a great job showing how there might be a little humanity in Nolan, when he almost killed Mark, he flashes back to the baseball game. I am very excited for Seasons 2 & 3."
This series is amazing. I'm glad that it's animated and what is unexpected that I never watched something like this. It's my first time writing about animated series and I don't regret writing and watching this one. I think that if you're not fan of animated films/series you'd watch this one and convince yourself. Whole story from the beginning to end is amazing. I totally recommend this one. Whole story and voice actors are amazing. Whole storyline for each episode was amazing and the characters are so much better than the other one's (in my opinion for sure). I'll wait for next season to watch it and see what happens.
"This show is the best creation in the entirety of my life. Absolutely perfect adaptation of the comics, voice acting is some of the best I've seen for any animation. The story and characters are very compelling and I look forward to each new episode every week. The animation is stunning and the artwork is beautiful. Rexplode is him. The relationship between Omni man and his family is a true display of masterful character writing, even after all he does you still love his character. This show is the best piece of work ever created in the Universe, this show is a decedent of gods creation, I love it. -Maddox Manning. P. S. I'm naming my son Mark Grayson."
"I usually watch mostly DC animated stuff but I'm glad I found this show, it was recommended by a friend and I'm glad I watched it. I like the new take on the superhero genre and it's interesting to see the characters that resemble ones from marvel and DC comics. Overall new and refreshing to watch, might pick up the comics. I like how they build up the plot and ad subplots, it reminds me a bit of Young Justice but with less filler episodes and obviously more adult themes. I'm excited to see where they go with this in the future but I've really liked all of the episodes they've released as of now."
"It was a decent show.The first episode started way too boring, but it was on purpose. To shock viewers with the final minutes.Then, the series was a bit unpredictable (which is nice), and had an average finale.But characters were uninteresting, humour was bad and romance was the worst."
"I don't typically get drawn in by the superhero genre, but Invincible is an exception. This animated series is one of the few in recent years that captures a broad range of emotions and truly brings them to life. I was pleasantly surprised to see the gore and violence portrayed in a much more realistic way than other superhero media. The voice acting in this series is top-notch and really helps to bring each character to life. What I think makes Invincible so unique is that it shows us that not everyone who wears a cape is a hero. The plot, action, and violence were all executed perfectly, and I can't help but give a huge round of applause to Robert Kirkman for creating this incredible show."
"From the incredible cast of voices breathing godlike life into these characters, to the writing that rips out your guts and cookie cutter superhero stories as much as it does actual guts...this show is a treasure. Not only are you constantly wondering (how the are they going to finish this??? -which they do perfectly, FYI), but you're also left wondering why we don't get these emotionally complex characters all the time! Kudos to Amazon for recognizing greatness, giving it the green light, and then allowing the creative team to do its thing! Cannot WAIT FOR SEASON 2 and 3!"
One of the greatest comic book animation movies of all time. Field with sadistic fighting scenes. Not to mention the cast and crew are stacked. We are ready for season two and season three LETS GOOOOOüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
"....6 hours later..... dammit, gotta go to work in an hour. Damn you Invincible! Damn you for being this good and addictive to watch !!It's been years since I've seen a super hero cartoon this good. I just had to go on IMDB and rate this a 10/10.Season two? Yes please."
I watched this show for the first time since I saw people talking about season 2 and the trailer but I decided to give it a shot and oh my god was it worth it. This show is beyond incredible and I absolutely love it and truly can't wait for the next season this year. I think everyone needs to watch this show as Invincible and Omni Man are two of my favorite characters of all time and the final episode was beyond amazing seeing what occurred and all the events leading up to the final episode. This show is 100% worth the watch and I think everyone needs to watch it immediately as it's such an amazing show.
"This reminds me of one punch man, and a bit of boku no hero, with a universe like dragon ball super/z but faster paced, with decent character development. It's a bit gorey but not in a bad way! Wow, this is the a great show, it's actually what i expected the boys to be, but i was majorly disappointed with this show because of the slow pace and hardly any action. I think this is a masterpiece, great acting, lots of action, fun to watch. Highly recommend! I would say it's the best western anime along with castlevania!"
"Binge watched the entire season in 2 nights. I'm still amazed by the story telling, character development, the story twist and basically its overall quality.Can't wait for season 2, it's a great thing to see something refreshing and tailored for adults who still have that small child inside that wants good old comic action but with a lot of soul and mature content.This show is perfect."
"First off this show is completely overrated and its good to see its rating slowly deteriorate to something more legitimate than the 10/10's irrational buffoons immediately spammed as soon as the first few episodes were released. In short everything apart from the arc between Mark and his dad is either boring or mediocre. Besides robots plot line, which was very interesting at first, it was strange for someone of his high level of intelligence, logic and reason to put Rexplosion on the Guardians of the Globe (the finest heroes on Earth). Especially when Rex is immature, unintelligent, arrogant, obnoxious and often shows the opposite of the qualities needed in a hero. Then we see Robot is going to clone Rex and it starts to make sense; he's going to replace him so his intelligence can be in an attractive body as well as start a relationship with monster girl. Did this happen? No. What actually happens is some of the laziest uneventful writing I've ever seen. Robot who is now a teenage version of Rex and he just explains everything to the team and they soon forgive him. There goes a great opportunity for conflict and controversy in the team later on, not to mention how much of a waste of time that all was if it led to no consequences. The majority of the time the show is just a boring and clich√© high-school drama. It was almost laughably generic, not even trying anything remotely new or original. I'll skip over the reoccurring plot holes science wise, like when Mark was going to Mars and didn't eat or drink for weeks, did he just sit on the cabin and wait all that time? I'll skip over these to spend more time of in-depth writing critique. Episode 1's insanely unconventional ending left the audience begging for more gore and answers as it carried viewers through the next few episodes of uninspired American high school drab. For season 2 I also highly recommend taking out crappy pop songs that pop up and unfortunately play every now and again. The spectacularly done fight and finally meaningful writing in episode 5 was a reminder of what made this show different and enjoyable to begin with. After a sludge through episode 6; we arrive at episode 7 and 8. Whew boy. The subversion in the fight sequence between omni-man and Invincible vs the Kaiju and immortal is downright august; the audience wants the Kaiju to win because they're aware of the consequences if Omni-Man isn't stopped, then Mark joins the fight and now suddenly the audience wants the Kaiju to lose for the sake of Mark not dying. Suddenly the immortal joins the fight and the audience is constantly switching sides trying to decide who needs to and should win or lose for the best outcome, to capture such a quantity of audience subversion is undeniably brilliant. Just brilliant. Episode7 is easily the best episode of the series. The fight and the torment Mark is put through in episode 8 is executed flawlessly however there's quite a lot of issues in this episode in other areas. First off, Mark was forced to murder thousands of people but he doesn't carry the emotional burden and psychological damage from it he should as he talks to his buddies about it over a burger, after the amount of blood he was forced to spill, Mark should not nearly be as functional as he is when he wakes up. Omni-mans motive wasn't very original or creative it was essentially that of Ego's from Guardians of the galaxy. The Viltrumites and their goal is blatant plagiarism from Star Wars, they're literally called the Empire as well. To top it all off they hint at a rebellion in parts of the galaxy as well at the end of episode 8. In conclusion, the entirety of this show's quality can be found when Omni-Man is on screen. 7.4/10."
"Its hard to care about anyone or anything once multiverse shenanigans become a prominent theme. Every ""big"" moment, every death, every achievement and just about every action feels entirely meaningless. Why bother theorizing about how issues might get resolved when this singular plot device gives you an easy answer to everything? Why bother caring about any character? Why bother caring about this ""main"" world (it feels silly to even call it the ""main"" one) when there's an infinite amount of them?Don't waste your time on this. Once you've seen one multiverse show or movie, you've seen all of them."
So far the best comic series ever watched. It's damn good.
"I had low expectations, but got hooked right from the first few scenes. I binged watched the whole series.I loved they tried to show some realism in a superhero story. I absolutely liked the anime style blood and gore.Great series! Cant wait for the upcoming seasons."
"If I could give something more than a ten only one, this would be it for me. 11/10."
If you think yourself typical superhero animated series you should know no you are wrong because it is nothing like a typical superhero animated series. It is so much better than that in my opinion we need more show like this. Everything is running out of original continents these days they should just the dog all those comic books which are on their shelves. This is so much better than the voice and so much original in many superheroes story line. I want more of this. I wish they can adopt the whole series.
"With an unfeasibly star-studded cast and the slightly janky animation of a DC direct-to-DVD TV movie from ten years ago - Robert Kirkman's long-running Invincible comic comes to our screens at last. I wasn't familiar with the original story and so the tonal about-turn of the first episode left me actually physically in shock. I was legitimately disturbed by it and I think it's safe to say I was hooked from there on in. For that reason, there does seem to be an (unintentional) context for the stiff and quite dated animation style, to make it appear like it is one of ""those"" films but to actually be alive with muscular characterwork, sharp wit, brilliantly observed satire and some truly jaw-dropping pacing underneath it all. Every superhero battle here feels tense, every twist in the tale stings - it really is a remarkable show.It's not all perfect though and the occasional attempts Invincible makes to function as a contemporary teen drama replete with cheesy contemporary pop tracks feel quite mawkish next to the vibrant, inventive and constantly surprising super-heroics. The flat inexpressive faces they've plumped for here don't help matters. That being said - the series did take me by surprise and the action sequences are frequently extraordinarily, fulfilling every whim of my teen ""what if Superman got into an unpleasantly gory fist fight"" fantasies which clearly lie dormant in my brain somewhere."
Awesome show great story and combination of love and action super hero's.
"So much better than the Boys and I like the Boys. The first episode was good until the ending. Then it was great. For some reason, the show seems to be put together amazingly well. I think the human part of being a superhero wasn't really developed before like in this show. Everything is really well done. Can't wait until the next episodes. Can't really wait until the make the movie. Hopefully sooner than later. Also, how does Image comics not get sued by Marvel or DC. Some characters are copies of their characters."
"Decent enough animation and dshum dshum battles but pointlessly sticks a load of ultra violence over the action. Soulless, humourless exploitation nonsense. New characters just turn up out of the blue and no character or plot development. Feels like they were going for the boys meets archer but ended up with a gory alphaflight."
"A great adaptation of one of the last Great Independent American Comic book stories. This is a good enjoyable show that you can enjoy if you have not read the comic. If you have read the comic, some of the cuts and changes while minor will leave you a little disappointed (changing characters, toning down some of the more problematic elements of a comic book in 2003 etc). If you haven't it is a great place story to jump to into. If you love the show, buy the comic books. The comic industry is slowly dying and we won't have great stories like this anymore if it goes away."
"I was insanely excited when I seen the news they were making this. Invincible is easily in my top 5 comics of all time.. the first 3 episodes were so good. N everyone who enjoyed it, r in for one of the greatest stories ever.. there has only been 3 episodes, n I'm already praying for so many more seasons. This story truly just gets better as it goes.. buckle in for an amazing ride..."
The first four episodes of this show had me glued to the screen with no BS build up and diving straight into action it doesn't leave the viewer guessing where this is all headed. The writers have cleverly found a way to combine missing parts of DC and marvel and combine them on here can't wait for more episodes.
Now I'm love reading the comic and the show is also awesome!!! Not for kids.
"I appreciate the way how this cartoon is portrayed for its excellent narrative. Characters matches very well without any exaggeration in their ordinary life. Sometimes less action would be better to avoid that reality is forced to assume that the presence of the ""hero"" implies the presence of an enemy waiting to act for his involvement. However, it is a very very smart cartoon fiercely attentive to details where almost nothing appears to be left to chance and people reactions are very natural and spontaneous in their daily life. A relevant consideration deals with the more and more often cleaver description of the characters in many series I'm have been viewing in their own psychology, nature, emotionality and maturity, acting positively and negatively making right choices but also wrong choices, where sometimes the goodness prevails and sometimes the evil, as it happens in the reality. A pleasant surprise. Many movies and series are not so smart."
"Great show. Solid story and pretty exciting. Animation is good and so are the fight scenes. The characters are a bit bland but im sure they will improve. Ngl I wasn't expecting so much violence but idm it at all. Voice acting is also great. Overall give it a try, its pretty mature for a cartoon but extremely entertaining."
We learn through invincible that not everyone who wears a cape is a hero....the plot the action and violence was perfect for this üëå üëè...huge applaud to Robert Kirkman for creating this show.... JK Simmons is perfect actor for the role as Omni man.
"Coming from someone who hasn't read the comics, this was fantastic. Loved the gore, drama, and characters."
"It starts off, and you believe it's going to be the standard comic book story arc, while there are still bits you can see coming. They are far and few between, and this show mainly springs twists and turns all the time, deviating from the standard. It's a really good series, with a really good cast. It keeps getting better as it goes on until the final crescendo. It's 100% worth the watch, make your own mind up."
"This show is phenomenal. It's near-perfect. The only single problem is Amber. Can we eliminate her? She needs to be blown to bits or something. She's selfish, unreasonable, stupid, And unneeded. All she does is whine; when the kid is trying to save the world, give him a break!"
"I saw this show just because I liked The Boys. I heard that irrespective of it's sometimes clumsy animation, the show and it's story is great. And that was indeed true! The end of the very first episode was enough for me to get hooked to this show.Some Negatives might be the character of Amber and the animation (at times) but aside from that, Each and every character has so much depth and a great story arch.I definitely recommend this show! 10/10."
"I really wasn't expecting it to be this good but WOW.Animation, voice acting, writing, characters, it's all brilliantly done. JK Simmons is a huge standout and I can't wait to see what else they do."
"The most brutal yet fantastic animated series I've ever watched .... it's full if fun, politics, gore and a lot of it, and story is just amazing .... I recommend all anime lover out there to give it a try each episode is action packed and full of min blowing fight animations."
"The concept and idea is granted, not very original yet it somehow works by taking a proven concept and recapturing it from their own perspective.They truly prove the fact that everyone can have their own unique perspective on the same idea. With an incredible voice cast, it never fails to entertain me.The characters are all given the right amounts of time and you will fall in love with them. If you love The Boys, you're guaranteed to love Invincible."
The 1st and last episodes are worth watching while the 5 episodes are just boreing.
"To be frank, it is a very exciting and wonderful series, and you cannot predict the events easily, and the bloodiness, oh my God, was very wonderful, and the animation was smooth and comfortable for the eyes, and I envy anyone who has not watched it. What I have now injected is that I want to lose memory, but the events are prolonged, and I did not like some of the dialogues. The graphics were very ordinary, nothing special, and the colors were very bright for a bloody, black comedy series. To be honest, the camera angles were okay, they were neither good nor bad, and the development of the characters in the entire first season was at a moderate speed, not bad."
Wasn't expected much from the average invincible comics but somehow they translated way better to television. JK Simmons delivers incredible performances for all his characters and Omni-man will not be an exception. Almost flawless tv show awesome soundtrack animation is fenomenal I could go on. Amber sucks though.
"Great voice acting, characters, story and animation make for me almost the best animated series I have ever watched, that there is no Berserk..almost!Over the years, I have seen all kinds of violence and brutality, but the scene with the train really surprised me..my jaw dropped, and the scene where Mark answers the question ""What will you have after 500 years""? .. ""I'll still have you, Dad"" ... ripped my heart out of my chest!For me...12/10."
"Pretty good, plot twists, however some stories could have been expanded into more episodes. The series felt like a short marathon. Hopefully season 2 will grow the storylines. I can't consider comparing Invincible with Jupiter's Legacy and The Boys, each tv series being unique in it's own way and each deserve a 10/10 from my perspective and personal preference."
"The first episode was a little ho-hum until the end, but things become very, very interesting from there. This is a surprisingly well-written series that takes the super-hero concept into dark but far more interesting territory. There is a lot going on in this series and it all somehow hangs together. There's a giant mystery that hangs over the series as well as a love triangle and the coming of age relationship between father and son. The animation could be better but it's good enough and I feel the producers made the right call regarding priorities - they chose to focus on the story itself rather than the technical aspects of animating it."
"Invincible is a good example of good storytelling. I don't want to criticize the show in that manner. Beside couple exeptions , show provides well-written characters, well-written dialogues, most importantly strong emotional scenes.My biggest problem is the lack of creativity. American fantasy-fiction story writting came down to 2 things, superheroes or alternate universes... And Invincible said; why not both. I am writting this review after the first episode of second season, so I don't know what kind story they are gonna tell (I'm sure it's gonna be entertaing) but after I see another alt-universe consept I just rolled my eyes.I hope they provide something differnent ..."
"Better than the Marvel's phase 4 by miles, characters development, dialogs, storyline. I honestly didn't expect that. When you are making animated show for wide audience ""This is the way""."
"Invincible could easily have been little more than a parody of other superheroes, with many appearing in the series it couldn't be more apparent which model is the original, complete with a generous amount of gore. It wouldn't have been a problem either, since that done well would have more than justified its existence, but what makes it one of the best superhero series in recent years is that it also has something to tell.The season finale has served as the first climax of that story, crazy, the truth and it shows how it will escalate."
"Wow. This show is just incredible - the story, the art, the voice acting, it's all perfect. Seriously did not expect that - I am never one to watch Anime style shows, but after episode 1 I was hooked. If you like Superheroes, or comic books in general, you need to watch this! Can't wait for season 2 & 3! Superb."
"Robert Kirkman, you achieve to do incredible work call mom invincible series was one of the most strong writing by your hands . And hopefully I wish to see more of this series invincible it did have a strong character build up from usual matters in families and some unusual relation between sun and father that if you like it or you don't the only thing that will remain finally it's the blood of the generation of the family or a strong bond of to persons with feelings of course or even more, the emotional contact that I got from this episodes especially the last one of the first season i it was fantastic fantastically attached to the end and the end was fabulous especially by the part that father and son especially the father will recognize that the only strong bound for empire it's not force it's power of helping or even better loving each other beautiful, also there was some episode full bragging about a person who will make robotic soldier and the government used that person if it's criminal that means that the government itself can be criminal too by the hands of law, at the end the balance of two choices should be be equal;
best of regards."
"I couldn't stop watching the final episode. I felt sadness, and joy, and fear, and despair. It was a roller coaster that started slow on the first episode and built it's momentum to the end. And now I can say - this is a masterpiece.It reminded me in many places the Watchmen comics - even the drawing style. But it's different in many other good ways.Can't wait to the second season."
Not sure what the hype is about its not very good.....the characters and dialogue are as bland as an unseasoned steak. Its missing a sense of humour...the animation is good but the script is boring.
"I just started watching it, it's quite catchy. It's a good show but it could be better without Jason Mantzoukas ruining the show. I don't know why do they cast him."
"The script is very rich, the characters are very charismatic and the series idea is brilliantly creative. The journey of a young man becoming a hero is re-signified here, it's super fun to watch this series. She shows all sides of the story in a very dynamic and creative way. This script and impeccable animation is INVINCIBLE!! 4/28/2021."
"HONESTLY AN AMAZING SHOW <3. CONTAINS A LOT OF ACTION, AND ADVENTURE. Wish I would have read the comics before, which I'm starting now. CAN'T WAIT TILL SEASON 2 <3."
"One of the best Series ever. Don't take me wrong, of course it have some flaws but not noticeable. The fights scenes between invincible and Omni man are incredible. And they adapt it to the comics very well. I was afraid that it wouldn't be very violent, but then i saw that Robert Kirkman directed it. And the animation are stunning."
The gore was a bit over the top but it was still good.
"I think season one of invincible is generally acclaimed as a work of genius, a plot that grabs you and does not let go till the final frame, excellent voice acting , and good animation. Some crappy episodes that concentrate on needless peripheral relationships, and other garbage do not detract from the experience overly.I was incredibly excited about season 2, but the first 3 episodes have been a huge let down, the relationship crap has gone into overdrive, ep 3 especially was a bad soap opera, absolutely nothing happened till the final frame, ( except a really weird side story presented in an even weirder manner ) I ended up fast forwarding a few sections ( which would NEVER happen with series one )
I am still in hope that things pick up and we can all just ignore S2Ep3."
"Boring storyline. Lots of whining and teenage angst. Some episodes seemed rushed, others dragged on and on. Pretty lame early 90's animation. Just seems like an excuse to animate some gore for shock value, but otherwise, an extremely boring show."
"Whenever one of my friends told me to start watching it, I thought I would be another, unfunny adult animation like Family Guy, or American Dad. But no, the story in this is good, the characters are great, and the animation is super."
"I never write reviews for movies especially not shows but this was spontaneous and i had to get this app just to talk about this.So realistic, it asked the perfect questions and gave the perfect answers as well as the perfect amount of them. That last episode was a movie and a perfect one. One of the greatest shows of all time i dont care that it was a cartoon. It was cinematic and i didnt see any of the ending coming. It was so brutal and dark and you felt just how Mark did at the end, i mean i could really feel exactly what the writers and storytelling was trying to get across it was amazing. And the whole last episode i'll say it again. Perfect."
"The world of the show is really cool, it is full of superheroe without necessarily introducing a lot of them, it makes the world feel really big.Seeing Mark's relationship was fun when mixed with his secret life. He's also a good character, he has good morals and him being new to the superhero life makes him even more interesting.Omniman is already, after one season, one of the best villains in TV history, he is a deep character and he's very menacing.The only thing holding back the show is that it felt generic at times and like if time was a bit wasted.I can see the show becoming one of the best ever with the future seasons.Season 1: 8.5/10."
"This series is absolutely worth the hype. It takes the combination of the Superhero/Coming of Age format we've seen before(a la Spider-Man) and completely flips it upside down on its head. Robert Kirkman has once again delighted viewers with his grisly story-telling skills and I can't recommend this show more. Can't wait to see what else is in store. And fyi, if the increasing blood spatter at the beginning of the intro is any indication, this show is not for the kiddos."
Show was AWESOME. The blood and violence proves cartoons are for adults too. Omni man is such a well writen character. Scene where he kills Guardians of the Globe was masterpiece. The only problem I have with it is some characters. I think there was too much of not necessary characters.
"Fantastic story and I love how it progressed throughout the season. Even the side characters storylines were compelling.It is rare for a TV show, let alone western animation, to evoke such strong emotions. The voice acting and animation are on point, elevating this show to an all-time great. I literally had a tear in my eye during the season 1 finale.There is no shying away from violence or gore and delivers it without going over the top. The collateral damage doesn't happen off screen and really adds to the impact of characters actions."
"I like this show its really good but amber made me down a point cause of how bad her logic was in this show.Other than that, I noticed myself comparing this to the boys since they are amazon prime exclusives and have evil superman like villians (kinda)But it's really good, I think the writing and dialogue is funking top notch and the story flows pretty well. Maybe it might be the hype but I just didn't think it was as good with its characters I guess. I'm still reserving myself for season 2 but I might change my score who knows."
"I've only just began watching Invincible, and I got to say, it's pretty good. Not I mean Rick and Morty good, but I think it's a good show and it deserves a second season."
"Muy buena acci√≥n , mucha sangre y divertida.La historia (para mi) no es sorpendente pero cumple.Solo sientate y disfruta!!!"
"-total 7/10-animation
descent.Once you get used to the gore it is good.-story
okay.It was more of a omnibus than consistent story.-character
good.Characters change during the show in a consistent way.Thinking that this series is a blast, I thought the show is more than entertainment. Having finished it, guess I was wrong.Need more background about omni man. I don't get why he needs to stay on earth. There should be more creative ways to colonize star than just stay there and maintain the peace."
"It's basically a teen drama about highly woke people revolving around a bunch of female characters without super powers that keep nagging their male partners with super powers, about how they don't make enough time for them because they are fighting bad guys, aliens and saving the world.The story has 2 very strong mystery plots going on though. That is the only thing that keeps the interest going."
"I mean it's marvelous I liked the characters so much
Invincible all the way!"
"Anime fan or not-if you're into amazing plot twists, intense action, and good comic relief than this is gonna be your jam! If you're a comic book lover this is a MUST WATCH! The characters are developed superbly and they've got a great cast of voice actors and actresses that you could even say might be *Invincible*The only negative I have about this show is that it's gory to the point of it being overkill (no pun intended;) so if you can't handle blood and guts you probably won't be able to watch this show. Also it's still got enough adult material in it besides the immense violent action scenes to make it inappropriate to watch with the whole fam. All in all though for an adult show is actually pretty MILD MINUS the GORINESS.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
"I would have given it 10/10 for sure. It has great animation which reminds me of the cartoons I watched as a kid and therefore gives a nostalgic vibe (at least for me). The pacing of the story is awesome and keeps the viewer entertained. The only problem I am having is (here it goes) that they changed some things in order to appeal to a larger audience: William is not homosexual in the comics, Amber is NOT black in the comics and is also not interested in the 4th wave of feminism. Maybe there are other thing I missed but there is no point. The show is great EVEN with those changes. However I can't help but be bothered by such changes because nowadays shows and movies are made/remade in a way to appeal to specific audience. At least that's my opinion, no hate towards those specific people but towards those ideas. Anyways, good show. Would recommend."
This amazing animated series is definitely one of the best of all time!I think it's really well done and I hope another season come out soon.My rating is 9.
"S1 rating for now is:
8/10.This review is here for me to keep track of season ratings."
"For sure what we needed in animation now, The characters are fun and the animation looks great! I'm quite excited for season 2, I like how they jumped straight into the nitty gritty."
"Nice Breather from your regular Superhero shows. The characters are tho weak and their motivations seem cheap. A fun and Good shot if Characters doesn't matter much, this is perfect for you."
"This is actually on par with Justice League , Batman and Superman animated series. And the end was a bit unexpected which made it more engaging and wishing that further seasons would come out soon. It's just that I wish it wasn't that gory, I mean people shouldn't normalize it as it was done with p***, mind just numbed to it. Overall a solid watch."
"I read a couple dozen volumes of the comic book as a favor to my nephew, who is a big fan. So Seasons 2 & 3 should be more appealing to Amazon's large audience if Amazon writers avoid wokeness, too much time travel, too many alternate versions of characters/universes, and especially too many side conflicts involving way too many superheroes and villains/monsters. I think a wider audience would be more entertained--and much less confused--if the Amazon writers concentrate on a few major items, especially the conflict between Mark Grayson and the Viltrumites, which involved battles, alliances, double-crosses, compromises, twists, etc.--with family and romantic matters regularly worked in. And Amazon should get rid of all the profanity they've added in Season 1. The comic book had lots of violence, but no profanity until sprinkled into the final five or so volumes I read. In fact, I thought the comic book's characters' non-profane dialogue was quite coherent and intelligent.In the comic book volumes, provocative items like abortion and rape occur, which I think should be removed because they could alienate a wider audience. So have the superhero heroine avoid abortion and have two children rather than one, and then remove the female alien raping scene.The comic book's romantic twist seemed so sudden, so clunky, not gradual. So have Mark and the superhero heroine finally get together romantically after Mark is badly injured during their defeat of the Viltrumite's principal enforcer (Conquest) in what I thought was the most exciting battle of the comic book volumes I read (""Still Standing""). Draw out the romance so viewers don't see the twist coming a mile away. Comic book readers, who I assume are mostly teenage and young-adult males like my nephew, probably care far more about action than romance, so why worry if the romance is clunky? But a much larger audience (Amazon viewers) could.The repetitiveness of superheroes fighting various creatures obviously wows comic book fans. But I think this repetitiveness will bore and thus turn off a much larger audience of Amazon viewers, most who haven't read comics since they were kids, and are seeing this story for free. Mark and his allies' conflict with the Viltrumites was extremely well done. So I think Amazon could produce at least four entertaining seasons by solely concentrating on this conflict."
"I was kind of interested in this show considering it had Robert Kirkman of The Walking Dead fame as it's creator and some other big actors and animation crew working on thr episodes. That changed quickly. It is nowhere near as clever or engaging as The Walking Dead is and or was.It is the most ""fine"" animated show I've seen. There are no storytelling risks instead of the hyper gore sequence, which just feels like a lazy way to make this boring story interesting. The dad, Omni-Man, is very unlikable, and so is the son. The story provides no reason for me to care about these characters. Things just happen to them without any proper build up or development. Son is a random kid who just randomly gets his powers. Dad is just superman but dark and edgy. Mom is just a mom. The heroes are all very bland and don't stand out, and all the cool ones die in the first episode. It's all shockingly bland for a show in 2021, I've seen kids superhero/anime cartoons that are better than this. Young Justice and Last Airbender do action and characterization way better. So this has been done before and better, by shows that aren't even for adults.The gore is whatever, I don't really care about that stuff as much as others (when you watch a decade worth of Walking Dead and Game of Thrones you stop caring), so it really just seemed like glorified shock value to me. And unlike the two previous shows, is just pure shock value and doesn't add much to the show in my opinion.The animation is also awful for modern standards. Characters just kinda sit there and mumble during dialogue, barely opening their lips and they rarely move or blink. Fight scenes look cool occasionally but it feels a lot like moving layers around to create motion rather than straight action, like a cheap 1980s saturday morning cartoon.I don't get why this show is praised. It's boring, by the books, and ugly. And any chances at humor are ruined by the lifeless, stilted animation. It's gonna be a pass from me. Lazy effort."
"I know only 5 Episodes just Aierd but this show is relly good good , nice story and Great Animted style and Great action scence .The voice acting is Perfect , grey griffn and j k simmons did worked beafor on Generator Rex show and by the Way the two shows are so smiliar and i have to say iAm totally gald about it . So if you loved generator Rex you will love this one .At the End eve Animted geek should watch this and i hope it keeps Great ."
"This show was great to watch, good action, original ideas, cool characters and costumes, but even though it is a cartoon/animation do not think it's for children or anything like that, if you start to watch it be ready for lots of gruesome violence because you can't abandon the show after one episode so if you start you won't stop!"
Really enjoyed it. Omnia man character was well done. The blood and screams made it so cool I forgot it was a cartoon. After all it has everything it needs to be perfect. Reason for one star taken was that I didnt like new Guardians of Globe. Some character werent really interesting.
"Animation at its finest, love the fight scenes or let me just say the action sequences from Mark, Eve and Nolan's flying to Dupli-Kate's cloning and dodging. Also some of the changes made from the comics are just prefect like Amber's race and character(though some say she's annoying). Can't wait for seasons 2 and 3."
"This is a kickass show. I loved it.All my life I watched black and white characters in superhero films except 'Watchmen'. But nowadays shows like this have come out with grey characters. We all know just black or white characters don't exist in real world, greys are.P. S. Though it is an animated show, definitely it is not for kids."
"Just watch it. Seriously. Stick with it. Great animations, story, characters, and its fun."
"I'm a fan of dark but still humorous superhero genre, so this series together with Umbrella academy, stranger things are my favourite. Have to say season 1 was a treat, a much better start then the other two aforementioned series. Great characters and plots that keep you intrigued and on edge of your seats most of the time. Hope to see this series takes off and get many more fans than it currently has."
"I went into this superhero show just expecting the ordinarily good vs evil. But no, it's not black and white, it's more grey. And that is something I wasn't expecting to see, and because of that, it's a 9/10 for me.(To be honest, I want to write more about why this show is good, it's just, I'm lazy right now)"
Best ever animated show i have seen. I never heard of skybound comics but watched this show and i guess it was the best decision I made. Amazing story and very addictive show. If there will be another season then i am waiting for it.üëçüèº
"Will probably update this review in the future, but episode one was great."
"Season 1 was a solid 9/10 for me. Great character work, great stories (for the most part) and genuinely interesting to see where the story was headed... Then after waiting forever for season 2, my god, it's like they sacked all the writers and hired magpies who only see shiny current things. There's no more depth or interest anymore. What a bad turn, honestly, after watching that scene in the dorm in episode 3 I've removed the show from my list completely.Shame.I genuinely wonder what went on during the writing of season 2 compared to season 1, because they are that far apart from each other it's like watching a different, terrible, show."
"Prime Video's Invincible is the newest stab at the superhero genre. The animated TV series takes a much more realistic and dark take on the infamous Superman character, as the show forces one to question the morality and motives of the main superhero, Omni-Man. The main character, Mark Grayson, struggles to balance his duties as a rising superhero with his schooling and relationships as he comes of age. This conflict culminates in him having to choose his family or friends. Due to the All-Star cast, the side characters have extremely well-fleshed-out arcs without hovering over them for too long. Mark's love interest Amber Bennett was the only blemish on an otherwise impeccable first season. The character doesn't seem to have any apparent growth throughout the season, and she comes across as quite stuck up and self-centered.I am looking forward to the next two seasons and have already started reading the comics."
"When I saw the initial trailer for ""Invincible"" I didn't really think much of it. It didn't look particularly good or bad, it just seemed like it was going to be another animated superhero show or movie. But after I heard all the good reviews I decided to watch it, and oh my god this show is so good. Almost all the characters are amazing and so emotional, which is highlighted by the amazing voice acting. However, certain secondary characters like Amber and William can come off as really annoying, and they don't really get any better. The 2D animation is also not the greatest, though it is still much more lively than many recent 3D animated shows. But the great storytelling and characters easily overshadow these issues and while I have admittedly never read the ""Invincible"" comic, I can say with confidence that this is possibly one of the best animated shows I've ever seen. I would recommend it to anyone who has a ""Prime"" subscription."
"So, I was really skeptical before I tried the new show on Amazon. An 18+ animated series, probably another excuse to show nudity and unnecessary violence, what I thought at first. But, then I watched and it literally blew my mind (No, it wasn't Omni Man! ).This show had everything. From a fast paced story telling to a steady character development of the protagonist.If you start watching this thing you will need just one episode to get hooked up! I mean the moment you see Omni Man killing everyone is a real dopamine boost you know!Happy watching."
The story and the script are awesome! Can't wait to read the comic. The fight scenes are great I just hope that they improve the rest of the animation in the second season!
"Everything about this is perfect, the soundtrack, got, action, characters and their depth EVERYTHING."
"Nothing to say. Just watch and you'll know, you'll know."
"I really like this show, but it suffers from serious problems in writing, plot, story, and character development Both with villains and hero's. The animation is also a bit 90's like family guy mixed with Archer.The whole show just lacks clear focus, and a ""mystery,"" that really isn't a mystery at all because you know what omniman did Immediately, it becomes about ""why."" Why was Great, but it took 7-8 episodes to figure this out, and tells me a problem. The Entire show revolves around this last 1.5 episodes, with the rest being filler per say. It feels like, to me, that the Entire Show was literally Written around this final confrontation, and I am not sure if the series continues it will get better, because of random villains with little backstory, random hero's with little backstory, incompetent ""new"" globe protectors that get beaten to Death against low-level Random villains, and so on. The show is not about 1 villain, but about Dozens that are not expanded on At All.There Is No story whatsoever, just the main protagonist/antagonist Omni-Man and a bunch of underdeveloped characters that Literally Did Nothing at the end. They even said ""we need to stay here because that's what we were told."" What? That makes No sense, as just 1 episode ago they got Beaten To Death by lesser villains. And Who Was Metalhead or whatever? Who was the white tiger guy? Who Left by the way, after basically saying these hero's were pathetic (he's not wrong) and Not Worth killing.So what should the future episodes do? Focus on a Specific enemy that is the main bad guy they are trying to defeat, with side villains that Support the Main villain. Like Joker using 2-face to distract Batman while the Riddler and Joker Trap Batman in some elaborate trap. Invincible, the show, has no strongly developed bad guy Other than the Viltrumites (that are impossible currently to defeat, as in 0% chance of winning). The series needs Strong villains that are addressed in-depth, characters that are not just braty teenage kids the Teen Titans could defeat with ease (meaning why Should we care that they Could win, which they can't), and Less Archer-style dialogue that mostly means nothing but filler to get to the next camera angle.It had an Amazing ending, the latest 1.5 episodes were strong, made sense, well addressed, looked good, and had emotional impact that people could take seriously and remember; But, a lack of focus and no clear way of prolonging a series with sun-par hero's that are useless (especially duplicate like really guys, really?) with a 0% chance of defeating the Viltrumites conventionally. Invincible, the kid, is 10000 years undertrained and the Only way he could even Compete is with insane Plot Armor that makes Mark look like John Connor.Edit: after watching it again multiple times since my review and picking up on more of the subtler details, I'm still affirmed that the Entire Show, as in 1-8, has enough filler and lack of establishment (in that every villain is only briefly addressed over 15-30 minutes each and then never again) to warrant a solid 7... However, that last 2-episodes, since the arrival of the immortal in 7 to the sad music-montage in 8, is Perfect, certainly up until before the medical scene montage. That approximately 40 minutes is sheer Cinematic Gold. It's perfect, and the Only thing it could do better is with higher FPS and animation quality, but the story, plot, cinematography, fight scenes, impact, Characterization, Framing, Voice acting from Omniman, and that Flashback Are Perfect. It is just a truly beautiful scene and it Really Shows the Brilliant writing potential that Kirkman Has. It's so good it's worth a full season watch Alone. It's much like the animated series Berserk 1997 in that the only thing it could improve are the frames of animation per second and more intelligent filler, of course written less like Teen Titans and more like Ghost in the Shell 1995."
"I really liked the show. There was a weak episode or two, but solos throughout. The ending was cool and fun to watch, but not what I was hoping for at all. Worth your time IMO."
"That's apparently what defines an ""adult"" comic series.Are adults really this infantile?"
"The best cartoon show I have watched so far. Comic writers and Amazon made a somewhat unique job like they did in ""The Boys"". Btw do you know what is better than Superman? A mustached evil rational Superman obviously."
"I have never been a comic or big superhero fan. Nevertheless, I have enjoyed almost all modern adaptations, but have never been hooked on a particular hero/series. ""Invincible"" was brought to my attention recently due to its reviews. After reading the synopsis I thought ""meh, probably another typical superhero story, but lets give it a try"". Not knowing anything about the comic books or the writer, I was pleasantly surprised. Story that keeps you hooked with perfect pacing and character development and a great ton of action (PG-18). Being fun and well executed, I would recommend this series to anyone."
Invincible has to be like goku superman and hulk omni man can't be the deuteragonist thragg has to be the deuteragonist invincible also needs some kind of energy blast he has to be a full vulturemite and his son has to be half.
Only Amazon original show I've ever liked. Pretty good story and voice acting :-)
"I read the comics of Invincible 10 times already and the way the show expanded on some of the stuff is done so well it always leaves me wanting for more.While the there are some changes from the comics some good some bad the good ones and most importantly respect to the source material in most of the episodes it always put a smile on my face, the people in charge of making are true fans to me at least.The characters have become so popular that even friends of mine that have not watched or even heard of Invincible know who he is mostly thanks because Omni Man left such a big impact in season 1 that even they started watching it and now always ask me when the new season is coming out and want to watch them as a group instead of watching alone."
"I watched the first episode and was baffled. The end of the first episode made me buy three comics and a figurine. The tv Show recreates the comic book really good. The Charakters all have a very interesting backstory. This Show has it all: Funny Moments, gruesomeness, touching moments and even a decent romance. This is very thoroughly written and done. I hope they make all of the comics as a tv show. And they also have a lot of Charakters that are all completely different. Even though some of the characters are complete rip offs I love this show and recommend it to any superhero fans.Spidervince out."
"JK Simpson is among the actors who's voice recognisable if not iconic in the cinematic universe and he does an excellent job voicing omniman in this adult animated series.It's an epic blood bath animation,they don't hold back especially the pg-18 violence in some episode,talk about blood.It's on the same list as ""the boys"" and it being an animation makes it a big deal to me. I didn't find anything that eschewed in sn1,sn2 takes a bit of time before the plot of the story syncs in but when it does.... amazing.Also shout out to the director well done on the story,plot,cast...superb job,really."
"Very exciting! Characters are great, story is great, animation is great. Series has really good writers and cool voices by pretty much everyone from the walking dead universe. Love the blood and destruction. Can't wait until season 2."
"It's OK, but I expected more. Ot had good moments, characters feel like they have a reason to be there."
"If you look past the over the top gruesome scenes nothing in this show is particularly special, engaging or memorable.I am quite confused by this overwhelmingly positive reception. There really is little to this show."
I wasn't expecting anything like this when I started to watch this show. Absolutely amazing writing and voice actor casting especially Jk Simmons as omni man. One of the best villains I have every seen on a tv shows adaptation of a comic.
"The story arc between mother, father and son is excellent. And further on some of the characters which you will encounter are just phenomenal; Machine head, Robot, Rexplode and Cecil are just a few. They are also voiced by an amazing selection of actors which will entertain you. Let alone the world building; one of the best in the superhero genre.And yes...it's super woke, but so what? It didn't affect the main story line and the connection between the characters."
"I don't feel like this series is one of those where you watch it over again and again. This is simply because once you've seen the first season, all the mysteries that give the plot tension are dissipated.However it would be wrong of me to not admit that I enjoyed this series immensely. After all, I binge watched it in 4 days after some friends told me the main character looks exactly like me. The animation and fights within this series is unmatched in the world of cartoon adult entertainment; anime not being included. The only current western animation I can think of that can even hold a candle to this is Castlevania."
"Wow, this is one of the best superhero shows I've ever watched so far! It has an amazing writing with shocking plot twists, and a tough finale! I can't wait for the season 2 to come out :D."
Each episode had so much story depth and action that I had no choice but to watch the next.
I love how different themes in the superheroverse are being explored. This is a welcomed twist and I hope that this show leads to more divergent themes being explored in the heroverse.
"This is one of those shows where you just have to watch it to know why it got a lot of attention from the audience and critics.It kind of feels like an animated version of The Boys, another ""what if superheroes really existed"" type series.1st Episode got me instantly hooked, and Episode 8 just left me speechless. If I had to complain about anything it would be because it's too short and season 2 is taking too long to come out."
"At first I was hesitant with the first episode, and wasn't sure what I was watching. By the end of the episode I was HOOKED. I ended up watching this first season multiple times. I bought the compendiums and finished the entire comic series in 2 weeks and I have no regrets. It was amazing, this series is going to go down in superhero history as a legend."
"It's actually pretty good. The story has a Rick and Morty taste to it. Don't really know why. The animation is not the greatest its pretty good, The Character development in not bad but still lacking. The highlight of this show might be the voice actors. Thanks to daddy Bezos deep pockets. In conclusion, they did a pretty Ok job."
"I decided to give it a try after seeing such a high score. The voice acting is ok. But the animation and character design is really sub-par for 2021. It looks really low-budget. The colors are way too bright.All the characters' costumes are colorful to the point it looks like carnival. Couldn't take any of it seriously. The story could have been written in one afternoon, literally.There isn't enough time spent on the characters to build any feeling or empathy for them.Apparently blood and gore = quality for most reviewers."
I wonder how in 2021 such a series was made so beautiful like Invincible. This is really a piece of a diamond. Episode 8 just made me cry and at the end puts smile on my face.
"Honestly it would be a 10 in my book if I wasn't reminded every 10 minutes how PC they are. The most abnoxious part is when the girl says with enthusiasm: ""The university has a great social justice program"". Like it's a good thing, no it's not, universities should NEVER be about politics, but be about science, similarly a show shouldn't be about politics, but be about the story. You can have it but not in this quantity, almost makes the person quit because of it which is a shame."
"I'm not the type of person who watch this kind of series but after seeing the violent ending of the first episode on YouTube, I had to give it a try. And you know what? It was the best thing I did. Marvel and DC should set their sights on this series because this violent and mature content is what is lacking in today's superhero movies.If you are undecided to see, take a risk, because it is very worth it. Now I'm holding out for season two and avoiding all spoilers."
"So, 9/10 of the first episode is like, what is this? Beverly Hills 90210 with superheroes? Oh well. But then, at the end of the first episode...whaaaat? Gotta see next one! And it continues like that, but with a perfect balance of teen drama, gory violence and family relations. Treat yourself to this one, because it is a hell of a show."
I am not gonna talk so much and will just tell u wether you should watch it or not .. You should definitely watch it its worth the time. Man I finished it in a Day.
"This is the best cartoon show I have ever watched in my life I didn't know anything about the comics, but it blew me away. The flying and fights and the weapons are amazing and story moves in a good pace."
"A spectacular show filled with great voice acting, disturbing imagery, and interesting satire. The way it explores what it truly means to be a hero and defender of a place (or planet) is explored well through our main character Mark Grayson. What he has to go through in this show is interesting but also devastating to watch. The world-building is excellent and most of the jokes are great. Not a single weak episode in this great first season, but there are odd character decisions and some unfunny jokes. Overall, it's awesome.The train scene is the most disturbing thing I have seen in a while."
"DON'T KEEP YOUR HOPES HIGHTHERE IS LITERALLY NONE OF SEX
so if your parents are comfortable to watch gore and violence and hear some cuss and sex jokes you will be fine.Don't believe the critics and reviewers they just over exaggerate this and this is basically just a superhero series where they will be atleast two fights and yeah there are bizzare creatures they may entertain for while and it's not as dark as all are telling and the most entertaining is just the last episode which basically ends with a cliffhanger."
"There are countless superman clones, this one with an ""evil"" take on superman being an agent rather than a being following his own will and who faces off against his own son, could and should be interesting, but unfortunately the aliens and superpowers are not the elements that need you to suspend disbelief, you will have to do that to ignore the fact that every single character has been lobotomized.Cecil:
Nobody, some insignificant government suit who for some reason all the ""good"" super powerd beings put on a pedestal and revolve their entire existence around pleasing him with nothing in return and no discernable reason for doing so. Not only is his position insanely idiotic but he is the dumbest character in a show with only dumb characters. He has a being who is a literal god, a being who can change reality with a thought, on speed dial, but instead of calling them and asking them to turn omni man into a powerless mortal or a harmless marionette, he sends fighter jets against superman.Eve: ^ this brings me on to Eve. In the comic it is explained she is not the most powerful being in existence because he powers do not work on organic matter. In the ""atom eve"" special episode this line is said, but the special ends with her removing the ""mental lock"" and freely using her powers on organic matter, on top of that she has spent most of her time in invincible using her powers on plant matter, so she could end omni man and all viltrumites with a flick of her wrist, instead she is living in a treehouse and doing nothing. The special episode also makes her incredibly stupid, in it she learns the fat, abusive, morons she lived with were not her parents, yet for some reason she still puts up with them insulting and harassing her every single time they are on screen, there is not 1 single reason for her to ever see them ever again for any other reason than disintigrating them, yet she does, it serves no purpose, adds nothing to the character, means literally nothing for the show, just 100% dead air.Immortal: In the first season he had very little screen time but it seemed there might be a character in the show who has a modicum of integrity, but right away at the start of season 2 we learn otherwise. He doesnt have morals or ethics, in season 1 he was just throwing a tantrum because he was outgunned and in season 2 his main focus is on dipping his wick in any teenager he spends time around.Dupli-kate: A character who literally only exists to be the superhero bike that everybody gets a ride on. Her entire ""personality"" and the entire role she fills on screen is being an easy shag for any male who gets within 50ft of her.Omniman: Where to even start with this window licking mongoloid. Destroys his existence on earth, calls debbie a pet, then flies away and starts having sex with Flik from a bugs life in less than 1 earth summer holiday. Which has all kinds of issues, we saw him end season 1 conquering the flaxans, yet now in season 2 it shows him leaving earth and just aimlessly drifting through space, so which is it? Did he drift through space and then decide to engage in beastiality and somehow have a child with a creature that could not be any more different biologically in less than 2 months? OR did he conquer the flaxans, then decide to marry an insect and again, somehow pop out a cross breed child in a matter of weeks? Also how tarded can a character be when his introduction in season 2 is literally ""hello son, last time we saw each other I tried to commit genocide and beat you to death with my own hands, I am not even going to say sorry, but come look at this, I abandoned your mother after breaking her heart and called her an animal, now come meet the literal insect I am giving it to and your groteqsue abomination of a half brother, I didn't replace you but I lied to manipulate you into travelling cross galaxies to rub it in your face about how quickly I replaced you""Mark: The protagonist of the show. A character arrogant and egotistical enough to dub himself ""invincible"" yet spends the bulk of screen time moping around, feeling sorry for himself and getting his ass beat without ever improving. Obviously season 1 finale being exagerrated and adding in scenes that werent in the comics to play up the gore was supposed to mentally impact him, but in season 2 he isnt mourning, he's just dumb, running back to the same above mentioned impotent mortal who failed to even scratch omni man or protect even a single person, the guy who lied to him and his mum for years and inexplicably mark runs back to him and dedicates himself wholly to bending over backwards to please him, mark could save more lives in 5 minutes than cecil could in his entire life, but for some reason mark chooses, consistently, to be cecils dog.All of the new guardians. I cannot think of a single redeeming thing to be said about any of them. The middle aged failed z-list ""hero"" with a chip on his shoulder and the attitude of a spoilt child. Rex whose entire personality is loud and dumb with nothing beneath the surface and he isnt even useful as a hero. Female ant man who is so pointless I can't recall her name. Female child hulk whose entire reason for existing is to be a balancing element to robot, and robot aka ultron, thats all there is to say about him, nothing remotely interesting, just a 1 dimensional trope. Between the lot of them there is less character and less depth than a henry stickman flash game.I am aware a lot of the characters are teenagers, they aren't supposed to be emotionally mature, mentally stable characters, but they do not come across as teenagers, as young naive people making mistakes but learning and growing, they come across like idiots, the same as the adults, every character in this show is painfully stupid 100% of the time. I like the premise, I like some of the action scenes, I like that it isnt strictly limited to comic panels, that they are ok with embellishing some stuff to make it translate better to video, but its so painful I have now stopped watching it. Whatever your preference, DC or Marvel, take that, remove any sliver of depth the characters have and give every single one of them the same insufferable, bland personality of skyler white and the combined iq of a shoelace and you get invincible."
"I read this comic a while back after hearing that the maker of the walking dead also has wrote a superhero comic. After absolutely loving the comic when i heard about this tv I was extremely excited. I can say now I was not prepared for how good this would be, the action, the dialog, the story and finally the star studded cast all amazing! Give it time the first episode likes to lull you into a sense that this is some normal bland superhero show but believe me that is not the case, its one of the best superhero shows out there. I wish i could give it a ten i really do as how big a fan i am of the show however the one thing letting it down is the animation. Its not terrible just seems abit shakey around the edges and sometimes lacks in some fight scenes, im sure next season it will be better with a bigger budget due to the shows success. Anyway except for that small gripe, if you like uncensored balls to the wall super hero content with a sweet story at heart invincible is the one for you."
"I like the concept and all about this new TV show , it's a little bit different from the classic superhero story."
"The best writing for the idea of an evil superman. Excellent animation, decent comedy but peak world building. Jk Simmons is the goat like always, his acting for omni man is gonna be great for years to come."
"The first episode is super boring and seems like a 90 superhero series, I watched til the end because a friend told me. After that it's incredible!Like The Boys but in cartoon,"
"... quite bloody, graphic and at times gruesome, not for the light hearted, but suprisingly good. I also enjoyed the Soundtrack."
Invincible is my favourite animated show it's also one of my favourite shows of all time I think if you haven't watched it yet you should definitely give it a go the horror and gore is dissimilar to alot of other mainstream shows I have ever watched and I enjoyed Every splash of blood the characters are complex and their development is vast especially omni-man turning from a cool calm and ferocious unemotional character to a completely different emotional and caring person and mark battling in the first season trying everything he can to become his father to the second season trying everything he can to not become him is such a great character arc and I'm excited for season 3 I have just covered the tip of the iceberg so if you haven't you should definitely give it a watch.
I have to say try watching Invincible as soon as it come out and I was so disappointed I was like what the hell was this crap and turned it off straight away but then my older brother and my nephew told me how good it was so I checked it out again and to my surprise it was amazing it has everything a series should have I was a fool to not continue watching it until now I hope there no people who try to ruin this series I would hate the show if it did just let the Writers do what they want to do and leave it at all I'm going to say.
"Every character is based on someone from established comic book. They even threw a Hellboy knockoff in there. If you're too dense to understand Watchmen this is for you. The target audience isn't old enough to watch R rated content, which is strange considering how much gore they shoehorn into this. Castlevania is superior in every way. If you want a deep story and gore that serves a purpose, go watch that. If you're stoned and need to veg out on lowest common denominator junk food culture, have at this."
"It has a great voice cast, and the plotting is a bit hit and miss, but the writing is pretty mediocre, with the dialogue occasionally getting so bad as to be cringe-worthy."
"I did not expect too much from this show, but everything is nearly perfect: story, pacing, voice actors, etc.I really hope they will finish this show properly and it will not be ended too soon.I can understand if there are some who find the violence too graphic, however, I think it works here, and it is well embedded into the story.Apart from the story and characters, which are both great, I especially like that you might be suprised with any new developments and twists at any time, and those develeopments never feel forced. For me this is one of the best animation I have seen in the past years."
Very entertaining. Good to see more adult animation.
"It feels like a normal superhero serie, until it doesn't. And it doesn't really good."
All I have to say is that this show had me at the ending of episode 1. And what a roller coaster of emotions!!! Amazing!!! And the casts. Wow!!!
"Been a while since Amazon's shown anything good.Stay fairly faithful to the comics, so thankfully it ticks all the boxes.If you like non mainstream all happy comics, this is the comic book tv show for you."
"If you're a fan of superhero movies/comics, this is for you. It's a mix of the Boys (which is the second best tv series in this genre) & Justice League. I won't describe much because this series is simply way above other series & in another level completely ! Just completed episode 7 and I'm just so happy and satisfied ! :) It's a must watch !"
"I like Invincible because of the mix characters and resembles different comics, television shows and movies about superheroes. It has coming of age along a bit of comedy while fitting in the modern and hero life style. Invincible is like watching Marvel, DC, The Greatest American Hero, My Secret Identity, The Boys and a few more shows rolled into one. The show would be good also if it was live action, but cartoons are also entertaining as well. The discovery of finding ones self and purpose to grow as an individual."
Best R rated comic series i have watched in a long time!
The only part of the show able to hold attention is squeaked in at each episode. Most of the rest of the episode is pointless filler. The animation style is drab and the romantic sub plots are overplayed.
"I love a good superhero animation, and I love breaking into new worlds I'm unfamiliar with. Graphics are great, storyline is intriguing, first three episodes make me want to see more."
"Deceives you into thinking it is another innocent Filmation-type series like the ones in the 90's - but then it pulls no punches with some serious action and gore! And although some episodes were a little slow, the characters and story are solid! :-)"
Never heard of Invincible as I'm not into comics but boy was I shocked! Did not see that coming :DNeed much more of this!
"The fact that Kirkman and Ottley are involved makes this adaptation legit. If you haven't checked out the comics, I encourage you to seek out the compendiums and binge read- the entire series lasted about 120+ issues with a few side projects in the Invincible universe published as well.What starts out as a lighthearted coming-of-age superhero story quickly mutates into an all out gory, sci-fi horror, mind-battering, plot-twisting, fanny-spanking opus.Best way to enjoy? Allow yourself to be submerged into this universe- it appeases on both an intellectual and emotional level. It takes you on a wild ride through Kirkman's rich, gifted imagination and does not cheat the viewer with lazy writing."
Just a warning there is a lot of animated gore and violence and not for little kids but I like it a lot so far.
Animated family superhero show just like The Incredibles. Also very good.
"First season does a really good job at creating it's own identity in a very oversaturated market of superhero media and blew me away, particularly at the beginning and end of the season. Just felt very refreshing. Definitely worth a watch."
"Give it a few episodes before you decide if it's for you.I normally avoid shows with teenage protagonists, and I do groan thru the scenes between teens in this show, but the storylines and adult characters keep me watching."
"Throwing into the story a ""multi-verse"" character just felt lazy and the writing was so juvenile and nonsensical I could hardly pay attention to the episode. Something so bizarre as the dialogue about curing cancer and climate change was in such stark contrast to some guy who has the ability to build some mind-melding machine and yet isn't sophisticated enough to finish the plan but happens to need the help of two dangerous criminals to complete his plans, yet these two characters come in just to tell him he needs more CPU power. It was just a stupid moment and stuck out so much I could hardly bare any of the drama that was thrown into the rest of the story it was such a mess and so disjointed it hardly felt like it was part of all that happened before in the previous series. The problem with using a multi-verse is you can answer everything with it or create any scenario with it, it's extremely lazy and confusing story telling. The one line where he says there are an infinite number of universes and he has access to all of them. Oh, so he has access to infinity. And in over half of infinity Omni-Man and Invincible take over the planet. What kind of nonsense dialogue is this? So wouldn't he be able to see that he was going to screw up by witnessing what happens in other infinite universes. How can someone with so much access to knowledge be this stupid. It makes so little sense. For example in previous scenes he has the ability to find his alternate selves and avert their catastrophic end by pulling them through portals. THIS IS JUST PLAIN STUPID STORY TELLING. I went from this being one of the most anticipated series I had to watch to having zero interest in finishing it, just after 1 episode.9/10 for Series 1
3/10 for Series 2 (and I feel like I'm being generous with the second)
So maybe 5/10 just to average them out."
"I had seen snippets of this series,and overwhelming positive reviews on YouTube and so after getting my latest Am Prime Free Trial I decided to give it ago...Sooo glad I did,from the stellar voice cast,(...which really,really helps..),to the brilliant writing and stunning twists and turns,this is a superb,adult-centric animated series. The animation is not the greatest but I suspect that might be on purpose and,really,it does not matter as everything else is just so good. It's an old trope about Young Protagonists navigating,painfully,into adulthood but it is done so well and the best compliment I can give it is I might get Am Prime just to see the next series.(..if 'The Boys' and 'Reacher' came out at the same time,it would be an absolute No Brainer....)."
Man oh man.. I just started to watch this series and on first episode it blown my mind.Shockingly awesome. Just don't watch with your kids. It's strictly made for 18 plus.Awesome characterization and story.This is kind of out of the box web series or say comics.
"It's been a long time since a last good superhero serie like this, truly."
It was awesomely awesome...like the beginning of first episode it looks like any normal superhero movie or animation but end of the episode was crazy...cant give you a spoiler but ya must watch..it has the potential to do more and more ya waiting for the probable upcoming seasons..
"That has taken the world by storm since its release. Adapted from the comic book series of the same name by Robert, Invincible brings a fresh blending intense sequences we will delve into the captivating aspects of the show and explore why it has quickly become a fan favorite.One of the standout features of Invincible is its ability to subvert traditional superhero tropes. While many shows aim to portray superheroes as perfect, Invincible takes a different approach by delving into the complexities of characters. The protagonist, Grayson, is a teenage superhero trying to balance his his newfound powers. His is filled with self-doubt moral dilemmas, and the pressures of living up to the legacy of his father, Omni-Man, who is Earth's mightiest protector.The writing in Invincible impeccable, as it manages to create a compelling narrative filled with intricate plot twists and turns. Each episode leaves viewers on the edge of their seats, eagerly anticipating what will come next. The show explores themes such as family dynamics, identity, and the consequences of power, all with a level of depth rarely seen in superhero adaptationsAdditionally, the voice cast of Invincible is nothing short of extraordinary. With actors like Steven Yeun, J. K. Simmons, Oh, and Zazie Beetz lending their voices to the characters, the performances are both their A, effortlessly breathing life into their respective roles and making the emotional moments hit even harder.Visually, Inv is a treat for the eyes. The animation style is reminiscent of classic comic book illustrations, while still feeling fresh and modern. The fluid and dynamic, showcasing the incredible powers possessed by the various heroes and villains. The show doesn't shy away from violence, making it clear that the stakes are high and sets Invincible apart from other superhero series is its willingness to explore and more mature themes. The show doesn't shy away from graphic violence or exploring the gray areas of its characters. It tackles complex subjects such as betrayal, loss, and the corrupting nature of power. This mature approach allows Invincible to stand out in a saturated genre and provides a refreshing take narrative.Furthermore, the character development in Invincible is top-notch. As Mark Grayson navigates his journey from an inexperienced teenage hero to a seasoned protector, viewers witness his growth and transformation. The relationships between the characters are also expertly explored, adding depth and emotional weight to the story. Whether it's the complicated dynamic father or the friendships he forms with fellow superheroes, each relationship feels authentic and contributes to the overall narrative.In conclusion, Invincible is a must for any fans of the superhero genre. Its ability subvert trop, compelling writing, stellar voice, and the perfect show for us to watch."
Honestly didn't know what to expect. Once the gore hit I was like....ooook. The storyline is what got me. Well done. In short... three words.That. Was. Awesome.
"Before starting to watch the show I had read a lot of good reviews and already knew it is a one of a kind show. However, this led my hopes so high and as a result I was not very satisfied till the last two episodes. The pilot was perfect but the rest of the show was kinda off. I was like I don't care about the rest of the things, just wanna see the consequences of what happend in the first episode which did not accur until the penultimate.Overall, I loved the show and believe that it has a lot of potential for its following seasons which I really hope they don't mess up. The pilot, the penultimate and the finale were absolutely fantastic and brilliant. So, 3 out of 8 episodes, that's why I gave it a 9, not a 10."
"Highly overratedGood:
a mystery, this is tho only reason worth watching itthe action is different than the average super hero stuffBad:
the art is really mediocrea lot of boring cliche relationship scenesbad predictable jokes."
"Lets start off with the most obvious; the art is horrible. It looks like the same ol generic DC garbage animation that we've be plagued with for decades now. Minimal detail, sloppy sketches that they slapped a coat of ink on and called done. Only the action scenes were done with even a minor amount of dedication, and even then it's probably just the stark contrast going from your generic daytime super hero cartoon to the good ol ultra violence.The voice acting, apart from JK, is just a bunch of pleebs that don't sound remotely serious.The comics were genius, and I only read them AFTER being subjected to this heinous adaption."
"What a refreshing take on super heroes - the show is full of potential. The action and animation is well done, great voice cast, good story so far.A real nice twist on the usual super heroes animation; keeping it a bit more grown up in terms of action and dialogue was a great choice - loved it and highly recommend. I can't wait to see where it goes..."
"After a long time, I saw something good amazon prime. It's intriguingly unique series. Waiting for second season die hardly."
We all all need a lot more of this show in our lives!
This is nothing short of genius writingAlso i love how the intro is blended with dialogue in funny ways.
Absolute masterpiece! Some complain about the level of animation but I think it is just how it should be when you compare it to the comic. Voice acting is top notch and how closely this is following the comic I can just say that there are fantastic things ahead. This show has and will have one of the best writing. The imagination is limitless and even the smallest villains have backstories and personalities.One more thing this show is not for children. So stop complaining about the gore.
"Interesting story but very lazy animation.It lacks the detail of Japanese anim√©
Characters don't blink, not much in terms of shadowinh... Sometimes they fly as if they were just cut out drawings with little to no movement.. in some cases even the mouth of the character disappeared for no reason.Good story but very poor in terms of drawing and animation."
"Amazing cast, great stories & really fun (often sarcastic) humor mixed in. Well done Amazon originals!"
"Okay before I say anything I just want you to know that this show is full of SURPRISES like LITERALLY episode 7 and 8 are freaking masterpieces. This show is amazingly great it's not for everyone I understand that but it's just great the writing, characters , the story , plot twists and like literally everything about this show is great."
This show is good is one of the best abult cartoon ever the story is so good the protagonist is good the blood is so good love blood and this show is 10 for me just amazing.
This is a typical teenager superhero series. There is nothing new here. Animations is good. Everything else is boring. The heroes and villains are very one dimensional. There is no depth in the story. Could not empathize with any character.
"After reading the entire series, I have to say, they are NAILING THIS! I'm really excited to see more of the show! 10/10 would recommend this to a friend!"
"Well written show that stumbles a little bit but still remains, at least so far, great overall.Diverges a little bit from the comic but in this case it doesn't really detract from the story or quality.It is good enough that I look forward to every new episode, especially now that the overall quality of most shows is in the toilet.Good story and graphic violence, what else could you ask for from an animated show about a super hero?Recommended."
At first I was hesitant because I am a die-hard fan of the comic and usually they get ruined when they get made for TV. I was also very hesitant that Robert kirkman essentially had a walking Dead reunion with this show for the voice acting. So far I was wrong. The voice acting is actually pretty spot on for 99% of the people. The show would be a lot better though if they recast Walter Goggins. Where he has a good voice for voice acting it really doesn't fit the character that character should have a rough raspy voice but he sounds perfectly normal. Even Seth rogen did a better job at voice acting and Seth rogen is not a good voice actor He's a one-trick pony when it comes to voice acting.
"I am a huge fan of the original comics.This show is amazing. SO well drawn, casted and written.I didn't know this show was in the works, so here's me, VERY pleasantly surprised."
"Loving the vocal talents, animation & the stories. This is extremely well done. Leaves you longing for more... In a very good way. Please give us more episodes soon!"
Easily the best thing of the genre right now. Hell of animated show. So far the plot has surpassed my expectations.
"Yup, I said it! So long as they stay true to the source material like they are...its gonna CONTINUE to be GREAT! Hopefully Kirkman doesn't pull a Walking Dead on us and relinquish oversight on his project. As I said, I've only seen 3 episodes but it's VERY good! Keeps heating up!!!"
Initially started to watch the first 3 episodes in Amazon Prime Video on last Saturday. Was very impressed and started to read the comics since last night. It's not yet 24 hours and I'm already read more than 317 pages. This is so addictive üòç
"All in all, a reasonable rehash of ideas from Justice League, Marvelman, Watchmen to name a few, heck there's even a whole sequence lifted from Akira. I thought it was meant to be good?"
First episode in and im hooked. Clickbait on amazon's front page - and the sweet surprises include famous actors voice i recognize in almost every other scene- from m. Ali to jk to steve its just as fun to pause and confirm the actors voicing the roles to the great storyline. Didnt think id ever watch an animated movie when im not babysitting but hey this is for adults and im all in.
"What a masterpiece, whoa! I never expected this much emotion from such a superhero series..."
This is one of the best shows that I have come across in a long time. I actually saw a scene from it on TikTok and decided to give it a try. The first episode was okay.... until the last 5 minutes! OMG. I have been hooked ever since.
I watched the first episode expecting a boring show about a superhero in training. The ending of Episode 1 caught me off guard enough that I got hooked to the show. So far it's great.It's a cross between Young Justice and The Boys. The fight scenes are incredible. It feels like how an actual superhero fight would go down.Awesome show.
"This is my first review that I have written for any tv show. I cannot describe how exhilarating this show is. Every character is so well written and sound casting is awesome. All the cliches and parodies that the show touches upon is so smart and on point. I dont know how I will be able to wait for the next season, thank you so much for sharing this masterpiece with us."
A masterclass of adaptation. Please watch this show.
"I have seen a lot of anime and DC animated films and I have to say that INVINCIBLE with only five episodes is almost my favourite animated series.I like a lot My Hero Academy, Seven Deadly Sins, Dragon Ball and INVINCIBLE is of that level.The last animated film of SUPERMAN was horrible. It's a pity that these guys don't have his rights.I wish Amazon keeps on with this amazing series."
"It was a good show but a few problems. First of all, he was not even close to being invincible. Many times he got the crap beaten out of him. Then his father revealed his true plan and said his wife was like a pet? So you marry and have a kid with your pet? If you are going to conquer a planet of way inferior people, why even bother to socialize with them? Just go there and conquer them. Nothing can stop you. No one could stop one of them, so just send in like 10 and they can conquer the whole earth easily. That part of the story made no sense. Then the father leaves after getting emotional while killing his son? Again, this goes back to why socialize with the humans? There is no need to pretend to be a hero, then conquer them?"
"The comic. Fantastic.This animated mess of a show. Not so much. The eyebrows don't match half of the character expressions. The flying scene where they just pass an animated layer over a backdrop but don't understand or use perspective was painful to watch. The FPS count is all over the place. Reused backgrounds. Screaming cheap. The story works well in a comic in terms of pacing. It's choppy and paced in a way that lets you fill in the gaps with your own imagination! However as an animation, it has also left those parts blank creating this strange timing and feeling even when character try to have deep conversations that just come off as flat. Yes I have watched hundreds of animated shows. Does this hold up? No. I recommend the studio take some tips from the Kimetsu no Yaiba team. I just can't even finish this season because it's so cringy. Story just won't save this one for me."
"Absolutely the best TV show I have ever seen, hands down. Characters are well-written, and the voice acting is absolutely superb. I don't know if I have a single criticism of this show. The finale came out yesterday, but somehow, I have already seen the entire show twice. I may or not have cried at the finale. If I could recommend one show to you, I would choose this one. I hope you enjoy/enjoyed this as much as I did."
I can't wait to see how they bring the events of the comics to life in the show. They've done a great job of it so far. The cast is amazing.
Don't let this fool you. This show is proof that cartoons aren't just for kids.The first episode alone is on par with The Boys in terms of violence. I was watching this show for the past few months with my 17 year old cousin and the first episode hit like a damn train.
"I'm glad to hear you enjoy the combat and storyline of the show! Unfortunately, as of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have information on the release date for Season 3 or if it will be dubbed in Hindi. To stay updated, I recommend checking official announcements from the creators or the streaming platform. In the meantime, you can share your excitement with fellow fans on forums or social media. When we see that season 3, and how times he takes I am waiting for that, so invincible that's name is iconic and more likely name and I like it's I love it and really love it. You know."
"Never heard of the comic series, and didn't know this was coming out. Only saw it because of 9gag mentioning it, but my god....this show is awesome. The storyline, the characters, the voice acting, the cast, the blood and gore. This is the best things I've seen for a while and I can't wait for the next season.Brilliantly made and should have a lot more attention than it currently does."
"Now that season 1 is over, I feel comfortable reviewing the season as a whole.From the end of the first episode I knew I was in for a ride, and the rest of the series definitely held up. Although there were a couple filler eps, almost the entire thing was fast paced, brutal, and somehow also fun.My favorite episodes are probably 5, 7 and 8.10/10 first season, can't wait for 2 and 3!"
It keeps you glued....to the screen.. awesome storyline.
"You will forget DC and MCU. This series is not only spellbinding but astonishing. You started watching and don't want to stop. It generates enthusiasm, what's going to happen. No words. Great."
"The final episode. A bit of a cop out guys. Glad there are two more series but please, don't make this like 'American Gods' and nothing happens to move the story along much each season.And now season 2. The angst series. If you're happy with loads of time spent on relationships, internal dissonance and not much action, go for it. The story hardly progresses. It's like that tough second album in music... let's do something in season 3 please."
"I had read the first graphic novel it is based on and I enjoyed some of this show. It is at its best with the fight choreography. Especially the fight at the end of E5, where the super hero team faces their first tough challenge. But, there were some elements to this show that I really did not like however. And that was the cringe-woke stuff. Like Invincible's girlfriend. What an absolute moron her character was. Also, there was a lot of stuff trying to be funny that just was not funny at all. The best character is the dad. Invincible himself is actually a pretty lame character."
"The story is fantastic, almost as engaging as one punch man season 1, loved the first episode and the reveal was perfect, episode 6 was a bit of a stick in the mud due to how rushed it felt near the end, also INVINCIBLE's strength gets stronger as he is learning but it seemed to go up and down depending on who or what he is fighting pulling you slightly out of the moment. Great voice work and good characters."
"Even tho the charracters seem to have been influenced heavy on superheroes that allready exist, this show doesnt disapoint. We live in a world where almost anything is possible using technology. The story is very interesting. There are lots of good written charracters and some plot twists that just makes this show amazing. If you like superheroes you cant go wrong with this one. The voice acting is very good and I recognize a few of them. Seem like they have a great cast of actors. I would recomend everyone who think they might like this show to give it a chance. For me this is a 10/10. No doubt."
"Great story, good characters and a lot of action. This show has it all, worth watching."
"At first I was put off by the generic carbon-copies of DC characters and the chunky art direction. One episode in I was hooked and loving it. With series like this and ""Primal"" - 2021 has been a great year for animation."
And it should be no surprise that I did. I went into this not having been aware that there are comics based on this series. I don't know how closely it follows them but I watched all the episodes in less than a day and I'm not disappointed in any way at all. I'm really excited for season 2 and 3.
"First of all you will find all similarities in plot like Superman like Alien is protecting the Earth but has a family and a Son who gained his powers around the middle of 1st episode and then the fun ride begins..it has all the action, twists, gore and a deep storyline of its own which makes it so great. I am glad I landed on this series by accident and boy it has been a pleasure to watch it. And basis episode 8 I can already see what next season or upcoming storyline may bring to table. It is already looking so promising for next season.Recommended for everyone, this is how you can still leave your mark even if the story has similarities."
"The show is very brutal, which initially leaves an impression - getting teeth knocked out being one of the gimmicks.But it turns out that everyone can regrow teeth without issue or metaphysical explanation ( I won't mention names, so as not to spoil).Just makes the whole thing kind of cheap."
"The show was inconsistent, if u have watched DC and Marvel movies u can repeat different characters of this show to them. Omni man came to earth in order to bring them under viltrumite empire and if they resist their planet is destroyed, it's the same plot as dragon ball z(an old anime), saiyans were sent to different planet to destroy them.The character development is normal but not very interesting. The plot twists are predictable."
Totally amazed by it. That dark and creepy vibe you get when watching this. Oh man that's EPIC.
"Written amazing, action scenes amazing nothing other than just AMAZING."
"I love the animation. I love the story, it's great that it shows animation isn't just for kids. Can't wait for the next two seasons. An outstanding show from start to finish."
"Honestly I wasn't expecting this series to be as GREAT as I hoped. I'm not really into the whole comic scene or superhero stories but I have kept up with some. & honestly this was one of the best ones I have really watched. I love anime as it is, and the animation in this was insane! Like insanely good I was surprised. Story line, the actors voicing, the humor, the drama, just everything really hits! I can not wait till season 2 and I hope there's more to come. I didn't hear about any of these characters till my nephew mentioned this series and honestly once I watched the first episode it was easy to keep up and understand what was going on. 10/10."
"Great Neptune! What an amazing show! My expectations weren't good when I heard its announcement. I thought it was going to be another measly superhero show, but once I started watching it. My whole perspective changed. This is more than a superhero movie. This is a superhero movie with heroes with more human characteristics than any other. Cant wait for season 2!"
I LOVE THIS SERIES PLS MORE FAST RECOMMED FOR 18 AND PLUS OR BE WITH A REPONSIABLE ADULT.
"I really liked this tv show, it is something different about super heroes than we are used to. It seems to me that it follows the wave of the boys, a very good animated tv show, I recommend it."
"Wonderful, marvellous, breath taking story. Will keep you on your toes every episode."
"There are literally no couples that are not interracial ,I say that as a guy that's in an interracial relationship, I'm just tired of seeing it every time I turn on the TV Because despite what the left wants you to think that's actually not the norm , Also some lower points because the animation quality is not very good and every single one of the characters are not original in anyway , The story is pretty good but again they're just copy and pasting characters from DC , And it's got that really annoying modern sarcastic ness to it."
This show is totally something New and special Thanks to the voice cast Who also worked in my other favourite show genGenera for this Great jop and Thanks for thr writters.
"Invincible (Season 1)A coming of age story, Invincible's first season features Mark, the son of Omni-Man (Nolan), a Superman like creature from another planet. He is waiting to see if he develops powers like his father, while working through the world of high school.But the first episode features complete obvious rip offs of every DC Justice League member. The handling of these characters does make me feel better about it, but it's completely lazy writing. At least in The Boys, another amazon prime original, it's done much better.Regarding the rest of the season, Mark finally develops these powers, trains with his father, and begins to fight disasters on the planet. This of course causes trouble with his ability to hold down a job at the fast food restaurant, keep his grades up in high school, and try to maintain a relationship with Amber, who doesn't know about him.Mark takes the name Invincible because what teenage boy wouldn't? He can fly, survive extreme physical damage, and fight off threats to the Earth. He is discovered by other teen superheroes and they band together for a while. It is heartbreaking to see Mark fight to keep his identity a secret from everyone, including Amber.There are numerous sub plots, all fantastic, allowing further character development from the younger superhero folks. Mark's best friend, William, while not super, is openly gay, which is always refreshing especially when it doesn't define him in one dimension.I am looking forward to the second season as the over arcing mystery is finally revealed in the last episode, but not resolved.Invincible (Season 2)Spoilers abound as the season is still new.The second season of Amazon Prime's cartoon adaptation of Invincible clearly serves as a middle act for a third season. This is not a bad thing, however. After the shocking and brutal ending to the first season, Mark, along with the other supporting characters, have to deal with the fallout.The new roster of the Guardians of the Globe, have demonstrated pretty sloppy teamwork throughout the first season. So they are now joined and led by the newly resurrected the Immortal. Their hijinks take up most of the action in the second season, which results in pretty graphic violence and destruction. Again, this is not a bad thing, for the viewer. Learning to work as a team, and Rudy learning to be a human, continues through the entire season. This includes coping with loss, near death experiences, and working with a cowardly infiltrator.Now that Amber knows about Mark, their relationship starts to improve, even with Mark's abrupt departures to save the planet. What's impressive is that Mark still continues to try to fill his father's shoes, no matter how much of a lie it was. He agrees to be supervised by Cecil just to prove that he is a hero, and will not turn into the despot that Nolan became. This includes keeping up a relationship with a woman he loves, treating her like an individual human being, and not a pet to breed with.This theme of avoiding a questionable destiny traverses the entire second season, especially since the viewer knows right away that he fails at avoiding evil in every single alternate reality across the multiverse. Mark doesn't find this out until much later, and deals with it pretty well. It is not a certain destiny that he fails at human morality, but a disappointment that he could be capable. It is no solace however, as he is still brooding about it as the season concludes. Debbie, his mother, also is trying to recover from being treated as a family pet for 20 years, even briefly joining a support group for spouses of superheroes.Midway through the season, we learn that Nolan landed on another planet, and fathered another son with the alien species, thus continuing to violate the rules of his own society. Do these acts of rebellion begin to make up for the war crimes committed on Earth? Hell no. But the show is trying to show some sort of redemption, though this viewer is skeptical. When the season ends, Nolan's fate is left unknown, though he is scheduled for execution.I am eager for a third season because I want to see these characters continue developing as conflict arises. This show/comic book has done an amazing job so far moving things along."
"Wow. This is the type of superhero/comic book series we need more of. This was a straight 10/10 but that does not mean the overall series will be once season 2 & 3 come out but for now, imma be so real this had everything i would've wanted in a comic book series. It was fun & bright but also dark & gritty due to the gory fight scenes. Steven Yeun was a straight W as invincible & don't even get me started on Omni Man cause this guy was a straight menace throughout. Each character was actually really interesting & no ep felt dull or pointless. I loved how we got to see loads of hero's & villains. Because i haven't read or seen any of the source material i can't say if it lives up to expectations but for me even if it didn't i'd still be satisfied just cause of the plot & story & also the writing. My rating for the whole series will possibly change cause for me i don't think season 2 or 3 will be better but we'll have to see. 10/10."
This is an supeb superhero series . Definitely worth in check it out . This series is not like other DC's or MARVEL's good boy! Good boy! Series..If you want to watch a superhero series with more blood and terror then this is for you . Definitely 18+ show...but who caresüòÅ .
I wish he voice acted for everything ever. He is also great in palm springs since this review is too short.
"This is a fantastic show that explores a myriad of Superhero tropes if they existed in the real world today, with a mix of both light and dark humour.And then .... it just gets dark, and darker than any superhero story I've seen. The gore is next level and could only possibly be portrayed through animation, and even then it is very disturbing, especially in the final episode.Overall, the story is excellent, but it takes you to a place you might not want to go, and there is certainly no warning this is the road you're on. Even the end of the first episode which is surprising doesn't match the ... I don't even know what to call it... of the epic finale."
Its a superman spinoff but that's all they copied well written and edited.
"Characters are mediocre. Infused with some feminism messaging.I actually like the character Mark & Omniman. Their relationship and how everything evolves.There are some plot holes:
if omniman were trained to conquer Earth by force, why spent decades protecting it first? Why the sudden change? - this plot twist is baselessIf Mark were to assist Omniman as conquerors, why not ""groom"" him young and early with doctrines & brainwashing of how amazing viltrumites are.. this lack of communication makes Mark unprepared since the ""programming"" is that he is human, and detached to Viltrumites' agendaMark took a beating from Lion guy and knocked out after a few hits. Now Omniman hits are definitely stronger & badder, why Mark lasted so long? He could have broken ""a few bones"" or something. Does the screenwriters just want to display some amount of child violence? I dont think Mark would able to withstand the beatings without dying or passing out.Other characters like Dupli-kate, Amber, Todd, even Rex seems very 2 dimensional, cartoony, their character is shallow. Not fleshed out enough with fears, motivations.I tried to enjoy it. But it's so cringe. I really dont get the hype and praises. It's just mediocre at best. Plot Twists are mediocre too."
"This show is fire! Character development is on point, the writing is funny and witty at times and the animation is great. Totally didn't see the plot devolving into what it has, so many different storylines happening- totally glued!"
"Shockingly good show. Inventive, impressive story. Another subversion of the superhero tale, ala Watchmen, Superman: Red Son, Kick-Ass, Injustice: Gods Among Us, The Boys, etc. With the ultraviolence, potential tyranny and mass death that would take place in a world with such monsters and gods flying about. Boasts some great animation + action sequences.A satisfying overall watch, with many interesting threads and characters beyond the core story surrounding Omni-man and his son, Invincible. Balances the high stakes and low stakes, the conventional and the highly, violently unconventional - Omni-man's mysterious quest and his battle against the Global Defense Agency vs. Mark's coming-of-age beginnings as the hero Invincible and his romantic / identity struggles as a young man. And there is so much lore! So many questions and partial explanations and world-shaking implications regarding certain heroes, powers and technologies. Damien Darkblood, demon detective! Robot and Monster Girl. The Mauler twins and their cloning tech. The cat warrior from another dimension that gives all the supers the work and then peaces out!! All of the technology of the GDA and Cecil's knowledge and past... And finally, the true motive of the Viltrumites and Omni-man as their representative on Earth.Invincible creates a big world that still manages to be small and personal where needed, such as Mark's disparate relationships with his dad, mom, Amber, Will, Eve, and Titan, which is an impressive juggling act, managed well through the season's run.More than anything, the success of this show perhaps indicates what we want more of from our {semi-saturated} superhero entertainment: real blood and guts, the real ramifications from superpowers played out to their sometimes thrilling, sometimes horrifying ends."
"Great story, great characters, very good sence of humour and is not affraid of showing a lot of blood - but the violence actually makes the story more believable. And has something that many superhero stories lack - consequences. Can't wait for season 2!"
"I like the philosophy in this series, it's beautiful and well scripted."
"Never read the comics didnt know anything about this.Watched all episodes in one sitting and oh boy ... this show hits like a truck, the gore the violence is something else. It has a more mature aproach to it , very well written, a lot of side stories that are gonna develop into the seacond season i think. Voice acting is on point , it has everything to succed. 10/10."
"It's bloody trash animation in which cyberpunk characters coexist with demons and exorcists. The first episode has a double twist and puts the question that going throughout the whole season. The series gradually with each episode increasing the level of engagement, so it's difficult to put the next episode off until tomorrow there is a big chance that you'll start to watch the second episode that blows your mind even more, and so on until you finished the whole season. This is that type of series which is addictive. I haven't read the comics, but animation remembered me of the old ""Ninja turtles"" 2003 series for an adult audience with a duration of 40 min that not typically for such animation TV shows."
"Wasn't sure what to expect from this as there are so many super hero series and movies in the world right now, but damn! Invincible is the best!!! With every episode I get more and more gripped, and every episode just gets better and better!"
"I have never read the comics but I have been told this TV adaptation is very faithful to the original material. This show is very well done. Great voice acting, great visuals, a very interesting story, and cool characters! As long as you don't mind gore and some swearing definitely give this a watch!"
"At first I enjoyed the show, despite the changes from the source material. But it has gotten too woke for me and it's a shame because I enjoyed the comics."
"When name-dropping is all you get in a trailer, you know what you are in for..Bad animation, decent voice acting, no story, bad storytelling, fair amount of gore.That's all it is, just a substandard animation series with more gore than usual.If you have watched absolutely everything else during the pandemic... well, you should still not waste your time with this."
"Such a great show so much talent behind the characters. Great story to get behind, can't wait for Season 2. Do yourself a favour and watch."
10/10 but WHO is mixing the audio???????? Audio mixing 1/10 series 10/10.
"I've watched until episode 7 and this show just keeps getting better and better
The drama, the action sequences, the gore
It's probably the best superheroes and antiheroes adult cartoon ever made
Good job Robert Kirkman and Amazon!!!!!!!Not good, it's phenomenal!!!!"
I haven't seen something this good in a long time.
Its beyond our expections...Extraordinary Superhero comics...Its invincible...Must Watch it.
Starts off as pretty good and by the end of the series it is outstandingly great.
"Invincible isn't amazing. Season 1 is definitely a bt different from some of your standard western animations and has some fun characters and fights. A well done and violent fight scene to draw you in, for the first episode. Good voice acting. The animation is somewhat lacking and downright poor quality by the second season though. For a show this popular , it seems like as much effort was put into the animation as one of those animations you might have found on Newgrounds as a teenager. When they fly, it's as if someone is dragging a still image of the character across a frozen backdrop, which is quite upsetting consider the show took a break after 4 episodes due to pressure on the animators."
This is just quite frankly the Best animated show I've seen since Bojack. Very excited for season 2.
"The comic is superb and the animated series lives up to the hype, adult story wrapped in superhero genre, coming of age, family issue,basically our everyday lives. Nothing comes in black and white, if you are tired of marvel kiddie superhero genre that just goes for laughs and action without depth this is for you.Hope they animate the entire comic, cannot wait!"
"Even though it rips off hilariously from the Justice League, it goes way beyond that, pretty fast. It tells new and interesting stories, introduces interesting villains and creates new heroes with intriguing powers. Even the drame and the relationships help the story instead of dragging it, s most CW shows do that, failing miserably (I'm looking at you Flash!)Everything in the show feels familiar (if you know a bit about DC comics) but then flips that familiarity on its head. I love that I don't know what to expect each time and the episodes are 45' long! I love most characters as they do feel human and as an artist, I adore the production values and animation."
It has new and fresh take superheros... with great casting and animation. Action sequences were a treat to watch.
"I checked this out to see what the fuss was about. Turns out it's about Robert Kirkman's ability to tell a story. He shows you how to take otherwise unremarkable superhero concepts and turn them into something exciting to watch, it's really that simple. It's obviously the kind of result you can get when a studio doesn't mince up and doctor a writer's original ideas, and sticks to the writer's raw creative vision by adapting it faithfully. I'm not even much into animation and I simply can't wait to see more."
"Invincible wears its influences on its sleeve-Lee/Ditko era Spider-Man, S. H. I. E. L. D., Watchmen, and even a little X-Men-and doesn't pretend to be something new (unlike Umbrella Academy), and this is its chief virtue. However, it's also suspenseful, has great action sequences, and wonderfully full characters."
"I watched the first episode, and my initial thought was ""DC ripoff"". But I gave it a shot, and I'm glad I did.Yes, it has its own Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman Flash, Cyborg, Constantine, Martian Manhunter and Aquaman (or is it the opposite; a ""Landfish""?). But this series is more directed towards the more mature audience. The blood and gore is...well, in every scene!This I will enjoy!!"
"I didn't know the comic and I'm not a fan of comics anyway. The first episode was 10/10 and got me binge watch the rest. However my enthusiasm started to fade.Things that I didn't like (spoilers):-Why is Invincible flipping burgers? He is the son of the most powerful man on Earth. They should be √ºber rich. This doesn't make sense.-Invincible becomes super strong after a few episodes. I like when there is a slower build up, such as in Naruto.-The girls speak like 40 year old philosophers, while the men are portrayed as complete idiots, this is now a standard in Hollywood.-Invincible tries to hide his job as a superhero. Just why do all heroes need to do this in all movies? Since when being the second most powerful man on Earth is a hated thing by girls?-You try to figure out the mystery of why did Nolan kill the rest of the heroes. Around halfway of the season you realise the only possibility is that Viltrumites want to take over Earth. Lame.-Why did Viltrumes wait so much to take over Earth? Why not do it instantly?-If Nolan doesn't like earthlings, why have a son from an earthling? Why not from a viltrumite? Or why have only one son from one female? Why not an army from many females?I really liked the gore and the fights in the series, but the plot is full of nonsense. Too bad. Or maybe I'm too old (32) for this and overthink everythink?"
"Decent story line, full of cliche American dialogue and scenes. Some ok action scenes but nothing new or better than other animations.The worst part is the in your face woke r√©f√©rences and characters.You'll literally hear the words ""sexist"", ""gender"" and so on. They even added a black Tom boy as the hot popular girl.I had a few chuckles and stopped watching after episode 3."
Totally loving the premise and world building. Love to see how everything pans out. Got me hooked.
"Invincible is definitely in my top 5 favorite comics of all time and this show actually does it justice. I never thought it had a chance to make it to the screen without major changes, especially in the violence department but I was wrong. The animation is even close to how I would imagine the original artist, Ryan Ottley, would have made it. If you haven't checked out his stuff, do so now. Amazing penciller and inker."
A masterful series about a schoolboy destined to be a superhero sound repetitive THE END OF EPISODE 1.
Best superhero show I've watched. Please make infinite seasons.
I love the comics and I love the show just the same maybe even more! Can't wait for more seasons! Love it!!!
"Honestly i didn't see any proprogano just think people over reacting and too sensitive! But watch this series its the right amount of romance, action, gore and plot to entertain a wide range of viewers. You won't disappointed."
This has been such an amazing show. The voice acting is great and the action is some of the best I've seen in any super hero shows/movies. I haven't read the comics yet but I will be doing soon. Can't believe I was sleeping on this show. Has quickly become one of my favorites ever. The brutality and gore in with the fight scenes in this show are second to none. Highly recommend.
First episodes were hard to watch but it got better . I can not ignore them so 7/10 is the rating this show deserves.
"I find most of the characters are uninteresting. Mostly, I just find them annoying. And some are minor, yet we're meant to care about them, I suppose. Early in the show, a guard at the White House yak yak yakking about his stepson. In a later episode, the stepson calls the guard 'Dad' who gets all weepy as a result. We've hardly seen this guy, and we've never seen the stepson before, so why is this an important moment? We don't see the guard again, but we do see his stepson trying to dig up a corpse. Is that why we were introduced to these people? WTF?The dialogue isn't very good either. It's a lot of whining and self-important BS. Most of what I heard come from the characters' mouths sounds fake and sometimes downright ridiculous. Most of the time I was mentally yelling at the characters to shut up.Yet another Superman analogue. In a twist, the series basically imagines if it were General Zod who came to earth instead of Kal-el, whose real analogue is the titular hero Invincible (who seems anything but), the son of the 'General Zod' type character. I guess that's interesting and has potential, in a general sense. But, honestly, from my perspective I'm tired of all the Superman ripoffs. We already had one in 'The Boys', also an evil Superman, incidentally. I wish could see the end of these knock-offs already. I don't even find the original interesting, and these derivations just seem half-baked, this one perhaps most of all.Blood, guts and brains. A lot of people die very messily in this show, which is meant to be shocking. But the most shocking thing about it is that nobody seems to care that much. An alien invasion has resulted in hundreds of deaths but the superheroes don't seem particularly saddened by this. Then the 'Zod' character goes on a murder rampage and, instead of shock and horror, people are dazed, at most.The so-called Invincible gets his ass beat to a pulp at least half the time. So...yeah, I wonder if the name has some kind of irony that I'm just not picking up on."
"The Good: oh man. This show has pretty much everything going for it. It feels unbelievably epic and was clearly made by a team of people who LOVE superheroes and comic books. Almost every trope, idea and theme is explored here to some extent. Honestly, watching this as a lifelong fan of American comics, I was giddy from start to finish.If I could describe Invincible, it's certainly a show in the vein of Miracle Man, The Boys and Watchmen, which seeks to deconstruct superheroes, but unlike those shows, it's not as cynical. This show has heart, with characters who act and feel like real people and it's not as doom and gloom as those previously referenced ""deconstructions."" I think it overall hits the right balance of realism and idealism, fantasy and humanity, action and story telling.And that's not even describing the world building. God damn.The Bad: I have to admit...the animation does come off as a little, ""under drawn"" at times. It's a little too clean and simple and sometimes took me out of the show. I also found Mark's circle of friends to be at times realistic, but at others a little too cliched and paper thin. In a show that juggles so many characters, I felt like it did do some of them dirty by the end.The Ugly: I love this show's use of blood and gore. If you watch closely, you'll find that the show only uses extreme violence at times when the emotional impact would be at its greatest. Naturally, as the show goes on, it gets gorier as Invincible sees the reality of the life he's embarking on. When he fights with the Teen Team early on, it's reminiscent of a Marvel or DC Saturday morning cartoon, reflecting the innocence that he views being a superhero with."
"This series tries to shed light on the real life of a superhero. And it breaks the template of Good vs Evil and Good wins. And ready to watch some gory stuff like livers, brains and of course blood. Perfect watch for those who wants to watch something about supes but in a different essence. One complaint, the animation is pretty basic but I can understand they had a tight budget."
I watch every single comic book show that I can and this has by far been my favourite of the last few years. The characters feel real and the they've managed to establish a whole universe in just a few episodes. I highly recommend the show to anyone who might enjoy violent superheroes.
"Whoever made this, Thank You, Thank You for making this such a beautiful movie. Thank you for entertaining us. The movie was super cool, the story, the everything. It has a DC style which I LOVE IT!. Dark Stuff and doesn't go at traditional way ""superheroes always win"". Meritocracy at it best! Whoever is stronger is superior. I love also the song tracks they have chosen for this carton or anime or whatever is it called.I love the fact that they chose the way of DC and kill superheroes because this is the stuff and no plot armor is there. The animation is kinda lacky though. It lacks and it looks like it's made with a $100 budget + community work but that's okay though because the story and characters stood out. Great job to whoever did this! You a legend!"
"This show is amazing. From the voice acting to the writing, the animation, the pacing, everything mixes so well together. Amazon, renew this show for the next 10 seasons already."
New fan to the show and instantly hooked. I really hope all is well in the studio and everyone is getting along. You created something awesome and hope this lasts a very long time.
"The story is a breath of fresh air. Lots of blood and death, which is why it's meant for adults. The character build up is spot on."
It has a WATCHMEN comic feel. Some good humor. Needs some nudity. The best thing on TV!
"I saw the invincible for the first time and now I'm looking forward to read all comics. Plus, I can't wait to watch other seasons, I'm all in man."
"You'll have this show, that's what you'll have. This show brings western animation into a new swing of graphic visuals and an incredible story not heard by many. Don't get put off by the first half of episode one. Things will gradually get better and when they do you'll be hooked like how crackheads are hooked to meth.The characters, the story, the animation. All of it is incredible and truly astounding. And it's only the first season with much more to go. Watch this show ASAP.It's a perfect 10/10."
"Oh boy, I thought this is just a typical superhero story, I was totally wrong. The protagonist is a teenage superhero and he's about to uncover the world of conspiracy and nothing as it seems."
"Bloody brilliant, Binge watched all the episodes available once launched. Definitely not for kids and what a stellar vocal cast.I've avoided reading up on its source material just so I dont spoil anything."
"It's like The Boys meets The Justice League and more. I was hooked by the shocking twist on the first episode. I just love how this anime keeps me in shock throughout every episode. It's not for children, strictly for adults. Your children will be traumatized watching this so keep them away."
A superb plot with lot of plot twists and surprises. A different concept plus loved the action scenes in this show. It's great too see how they build main character. And the main thing is he isn't the only one to have limelight of whole show . Ending was great too . Just waiting for second season.
I only watch the first episode and I already know this is great. I got to the end and I was shocked wow. Any how longer are episodes of great awesome and so far the character developments pretty cool.I can't wait to see what happens next.
"This series will certainly not be for casual viewers. Fans of the comic will rejoice and scream manically at the idiot casuals who have no idea this series is based on a comic. Before you leave a negative review, understand what you're even reviewing. Invincible could possibly be the best comic animated adaptation ever created, next to Spawn the HBO series. This series gets a perfect score from me and definitely earns a spot on my collection shelf when the DVD boxsets finally release."
This is probabaly the most bloody animated series I have ever watched. To the point where it is absolutely excessive and it is obvious it is trying to disgust the viewer. Through this it does make a good point of illustrating how little regular humans mean to some superheroes. The story is fresh and intreguing and have some interesting character developments. I am not too keen ok the superhero theme but still enjoyed my time.
"More shows that push social justice, characters are all single minded. It could be a better show if they drop the pandering."
"After seeing a few interesting clips on YouTube, and seeing the high rating on here. I wanted to give this show a try, but I was not excited. But as soon as Episode 1 ended, I was in awe. The show is crazy good, and it's surprisingly violent. I really like the characters as well, and the show has some amazing shock value. I've been having a great time watching, and I'm looking forward to finishing the season! I'm not a fan of animation/anime, but I am definitely a fan of this."
"Never heard, read or seen the comics....saw it on some recommendations of my favourite websites......didn't disappoint...All sups are copies of DC greats..still this is classic...reminded of Boyz.........I didnt know anything about this comics or series ...but a solid 9......"
I love everything's night this show! In particular the voice acting from Mark Grayson and Cecil. I would never be able to tell you that was Walton Goggins if he wasn't credited. The action for an animated superhero show is the best I can ever remember. The story is very engaging and never a full moment. I don't feel like any characters are unbearable so far they all for the most part are quite intriguing.
"For decades whenever people have thought about the superhero genre, they naturally think of either Marvel or DC. In more recent years other brands have entered the genre and have been just as popular as the two big names and invincible is one of them. If you look past the lazy animation, it's actually got a really good storyline. If you had to imagine what the justice league would be like if superman turned bad, this is it."
"All I can say is WOW. Watch this anime if you enjoy: unexpected twists, humour, kick ass fight scenes and excellent writing. I'm only on episode 5 (the next one is released on my birthday!) and just WOW. It totally blew my expectations out of the water and into space. Incredible."
"Invincible is underrated gem based on comic. Most amazing point of this series is it's rating and story delivering..u can watch its next episode after watching previous..
Can't wait to see it's universe."
3 episodes down. It's already looking promising in every aspect.
"Invincible is one of the best shows I've watched this year. It's fun, animated pretty well, has a gripping premise and doesn't hold back on showing violence. I had no idea about the comics and I guess that's why I enjoyed it more. I highly recommend watching it if you're into superhero stuff. You'll have a great time!"
"Take away all the side stories and this series is savage! Though it's not JLA, but it's a nod to it. Reminds me a lot of Red Son in its unqiue story arc, what if Superman goes berserk and kills off all the JLA members? Looking forward to season 2!"
"Tldr; interesting premise/concept that has been done better by the likes of the original comic and 1st movie of the Watchmen. Should have been more creative instead of directly copying because they only do enough to avoid legal issues; go no further than Grayson and you can easily figure that out. For people who don't pay attention to DC/Marvel/SuperHero Comics, then this series might feel like the best thing ever to them-10/10 stars.(Mar)k Grayson is a exact clone and carbon copy of (Dic)k Grayson. For example; both characters get sexually assaulted by a woman within their storyline, both characters have the naive teen male super hero mentality, similar costume designs, their first and last names are so similar it is only different by the 1st three letters.You will see similarities like this through out the series with other characters and several other concepts (like a alien from another universe who becomes the strongest super hero on earth, aka Superman/Omniman) present in the ""Invincible"" universe. They only do enough difference in order to avoid legal issues. When it comes to creative works, I believe they can do better, because the premise is so interesting. So to me, this was very lazy of them. They could have made their characters more original; while still doing a more adult and grittier reality of, ""So you want to be a super hero?!"" and criticizing some of the tropes within DC/Marvel/SuperHero Comics.I hear a lot of people saying ""The Boys"" did it best. I haven't seen that yet, but I have seen the Watchmen (not the hbo series), and it does a far better job at this. Having literally its own source material, while Invincible relies heavily on other comics to makes its' heroes.Another issue I have with Invincible is the animation quality, the sound between the voices and effects were not balanced out, and the acting isn't top tier like most Anime Studios (think Dragon Ball Super).Ultimately, this cartoon tv series will be perfect for people who don't pay attention to DC/Marvel/SuperHero Comics/Movies/Tvseries. It will more than likely be a 9/10 star series for them. If you are into things like Watchmen, you will like this as well, but a little less, probably at a 5/6 star level. However if you are a person like me and hate lazy creative artworks, that borrows heavily from other intellectual properties; then read below-So I'll give Invincible +1 star for the premise/concept and +1 star for humorous dialogue (which is mostly thanks to some of the melo-teen drama within the show); a grand total of 2 stars out of 10. Because just being violent, having more mature adult themes, and hour long episodes-doesn't take away the fact they could have been more original. There is way too much competition out there like the Fox's X-Men, The Dark Knight, Watchmen, MCU films (especially End Game), and DCU films-to be doing stuff like this."
The comic was great so many twists! The show so far has not disappointed. The little changes they have made from the comic are not annoying and seem to fit a TV show platform.
"Why can I see it and all its characters then huh? If something is Invincible its not able to be seen, but clearly they don't know anything about the leech king."
"1. The story
2. The casting
3. The character dynamics
4. The guest stars
5. The music
6. The introI really look forward to this show each week LOL."
Best superhero show ever. Ever. The comics are better but this show gives it so much depth. Can't wait to see what the later seasons bring and I can't wait for the live action movie.
"The graphicness and dialogue is truly smart and witty, and it's breaking some superhero stereotypes quite ironically and the father and son are truly something to behold!! Animation keeps up with the scale and incredible action!! The relationship between Mark and Eve is simply to die for!!!"
"I just can't wait for new episodes
It is really mistress."
"Absolutely stunning. The emotional dynamic is amazing. I've never seen a cartoon so well voice acted, so emotive, so raw. It started out a bit lame, like it was going to be a cheesy woke PG13 cartoon... but quickly grew VERY adult in content. They race swapped Amber from a white blond girl to a black woman... for what? Extra race points? Why bother changing that. The Comic is very diverse as it is... This annoyed me and I barely managed to finish episode one because of it. It's an insult to black people to use them as pawns for woke culture bonus points. BUT, that said, once I watched episode two I was absolutely hooked. I've read the comics up to number 95, re-read half of that many twice. Amazing comics. I'm back up to 36 now again. Life keeps getting busy. I'm so glad I gave this show a chance. The finale had me teary eyed, it was so well voice acted, so emotional."
"The show is really entertaining and it has also good plot and the final was like wow. I didnt expect that omni man would never mind his family. From the first episodes, there was a hope about him for me. Anyways, i really liked the show and i give it 8.5 out of ten, but hopefully people wont overstate it. But maybe the ratings would decrease anyway."
"The animation is good and the underlying material is great. Pretty hard not to mess up in fact. Solid Star voice actors. Overall entertaining. The forced DEI girlfriend, which diverges form the source material for no other reason, would be insufferable whether she was black, white, purple or polka dotted. Why they decided to make the main character's love interest an absolutely unbearable b word is beyond me. So yeah, pretty annoying. But the show has enough good points that it's still worth watching. Hopefully it will improve as the seasons go on. No idea why my review has to be 700 characters."
More Please! An hour long animated series?? It's so fun and exciting. I hope there's a lot more in store.
"Im still yet to find something to compete with this masterpiece. Everything is perfect, the romance, the action, the story, and the iconic unique characters, down to even the most minute details, such as Anissa's blood freezing in space when alan punches her. Even though this show is getting plenty of attention, i still think its underrated. Their only flaw was releasing the show between 12 am to 4am throughout the whole US during season 2. During the time gap for the seasons i decided to read the whole comic series too (which i highly recommend) because it makes the show 100x better watching it get animated. I love this show so much there wouldnt be anything more id want more then to be a part of it, perhaps one day, I could voice Anissa's and Mark's son ""Markus"" if i can meet the requirements in time."
"I don't like superhero movies/shows, I'm not into comics and I'm not big on animated series......but this.is. AWESOME! The greatest animated show I have ever watched and cannot wait for the next two seasons!"
Amazing character development with a crazy story line that keeps you guessing. Entertaining the entire way. Violence and gore at unexpected moments. What a ride. THERE BETTER BE SEASON 2!!!
"It like the Boys, this one is as good, which says its perfect."
"Disclaimer: I've never read the comics so this story was completely new to me. My review is entirely based on the show and how it approaches this story.If you like The Boys, you will like Invincible. This was a happy surprise for me. I had seen the hype it was getting on social media but wasn't sure if it was something I'd be into. I finished this show in a day. Way too good, could not stop watching. I just wanted to know what would happen next and get the answer to why the big event at the beginning happened. Now mind you, it turned out to be exactly what I thought it was (the story, who the villain is, etc.) but even so the journey to getting this mystery solved was very entertaining and wild. I still have Marvel fatigue and I don't see that healing anytime soon given Marvel's control of the movie world, so it's good to watch stories like this one that aren't in the typical superhero fashion and don't go overboard to be edgy like Deadpool, but rather tell stories that make sense and fit with the crazy world we're living in. All the characters had traits that made them unique and entertaining. This is one of very few shows where there is not a character I didn't like. Even the villain, obviously I don't want him to win, but the way he's written - he's funny. He's an actual villain, he is technically a twist villain; a trope that's being used to death lately in films and television. But the way this one is done, there's a lot more at stake with him being the villain. It's more complex than Star Lord's planet dad turning out to be a villain. The writing on this show is great, the voice acting is great. It's done in a mix of 2D animation with some 3D effects tossed in. Feels like a show I could've watched on regular TV as a kid.I highly recommend this one. One of the best shows that's come out this year. Excited for season 2 !"
"This show completely blew my expectations. I never expected a superhero show could surprise me that much, at first I thought it was going to be another show like ""The Boys"" which is really good but I was wrong. I found the story to be very unique and profound.Don't read the comics! They will completely ruin the experience, I am so glad that i watched it without knowing a thing about these characters."
"The voice acting was decent from the two main heroes, but there was a steep drop-off when it came to side characters and ensemble. It was disturbingly violent at times, but that's part of the charm and entertainment of this brand of action show. The animation was good, except frequent use of lazy 3D models for buildings and vehicles. It tried very hard to be funny but fell short most of the time. There seems to be a satirical element in the comics that is entirely missing from the show. The plot was full of twists and turns, and the writers did a good job of keeping filler to a minimum. I'm excited for season two and will certainly see it when it's released."
"Like any superhero story, one must be able to dispense with some realism to derive enjoyment. Despite doing so, I was unable to understand why this series is so well-regarded. The superheroes are rip-offs of other comic book protagonists and infinitely more powerful than ordinary people, the story is nothing remarkable and the romance is tiresome to get through. It is only the comic elements and good animation and voice acting that kept me going till the end of the season.Perhaps prior knowledge of the Invincible comics would give one a better appreciation of this show."
Smartly written. Beautifully animated. Well acted. A fantastic show that brings a different energy to the screens than most of the stuff on now. Cant wait for season 2.
"UPDATE: This show is honestly the best think you will watch, I have watched this two times in a year and everything about is top notch, the isn't an animation for just those who love animations. It touches on everything that makes a great show in the right way. Anyone doubting should you watch it , honestly do it, your life will be for the better.What a great show, been struggling to find anything and this is what I needed. Finished the season in a DAY! Loves how they depicted the real world brutality that would come with the ability to punch through a wall. It had a deep story throughout and honesty could not ask for more. Not just for us comic book nerd types, give it a watch!"
Wait what did I just watch? Great chracters and really well done animation. Yes it's a little violent but I like it like that.
"I have never been so affected by anything animated like I have been by Invincible. Shocking. Stunning. Powerfully moving.The first episode rocks you into a sense of familiar comfort and then ROCKS you straight across the shins with a baseball bat. And that beautiful pattern repeats, to the viewer's delight, over and over and over.How is it possible that 2d animation can leave me shaken, watching through my fingers, squirming in my chair, mouth agape, and totally clueless as to what's coming next.Everything about Invincible, from the cast, the story, the writing, the little design pieces, all the way down to a superb soundtrack ... just brilliant."
"This is my first review on this app, and I'm so glad I picked this show. I was recommended this show by a buddy and I decided to give it a try. I noticed the 18+ rating and was confused because of how warm and funny the first 30 minutes were. I quickly realized why it was rated that. My mind was blown (kind of like Red Rush). I'm glad I went into this blind, having never read the comics. Steven Yeun, Sandra Oh, and J. K. Simmons absolutely killed it, and so did everyone else. The brutality, the comedy, and the coming of age themes add up for one awesome show. Parents, DO NOT watch this with your kids."
"I can't emphasize enough how a 1 season of tv show is almost everything I wanted in mature animated tv show and far more.I'm an huge super hero fan and comic book fan and this show makes me a fan I'm an instant.The writing is incredible,the animation is not always complete but when it is they have some insanely gore beautiful goodness and greatness
Because of this show I've bought all 3 compendiums of comics and read them and ow boy are we in for a ride.Please watch invincible it's perfect."
I cannot wait for season 2 my only problem is at times the animation looks cheep but it's still amazing and not very distracting unless your looking for it and it had some of the best action and dialogue in animation.
This show is awesome except for the amber character. There approach to try and make her woke strong female was piss poor at best. Her character is terribly written and really brings down the quality of the show. Hopefully at the first episode of the second season mark leaves her and they move on with the show without her. That's why I'm giving it an 7 and not a 10.
If this doesn't pick up after this season I'll lose all hope üòî in the industry. This is great!!
Binge watched all episodes. Probably the best anime that I've watched after Attack on Titans.
"I outgrew superhero comics a long time ago, and I feel they set a low bar for what comics as a format are capable of. Invincible, though, breaks through with a more thoughtful and complicated narrative that you could compare to the Watchmen comics, or more matured genre work such as Largo Winch and Transmetropolitan. I'm not sure why people complain this is 'woke' - there's no agenda here. Just a reminder that Rob Kirkman might one day sit alongside the likes of Alan Moore and Neil Gaiman in terms of contributing to the evolution of storytelling in comic books.Yes, the show is an adaptation and not the comics. But I'd go buy and read Invincible right now if I didn't worry it would spoil season 2!"
"Fantastic animated series, let's face it the gore is the main hook, and it is great. Not a family friendly series. Looking forward to season 2."
"I honestly cannot comprehend how a show with only 8 episodes can give me feelings stronger than most other positively rated ones. It starts off a little cliche-ish in episode 1 but COMPLETELY turns that around without any remorse. Action is arguably a 9.5/10, the characters and their development in SUCH A SHORT TIME is a clear 10/10 and oh my God I cannot express my feelings for the music choice. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I hear ANY song playing I seriously lose my mind,11/10. I have just finished the last episode of season 1 and I am DYING for more content. Please watch Invincible. It's worth it."
"And this show is just what I needed.This show is just a gem, gore and violence mixed with pretty good character development and great humor in between. Just perfect."
"I'll be coming up the comic after the entire tv series is done, so I can avoid spoilers. I hate the DC and MCU...Generic clich√©s, good triumphs evil, sarcastic/witty jokes, yada yada yada.Invincible is the opposite with truly unique stories and a realistic look at what being a hero would entail.Spectacular animation, natural dialog, good humor, great pacing, and just good addictive binge-worthy vibes. An absolute masterpiece."
"How it started: Meh, another comic superhero show.How it's going: The final scene in Episode 1 got me hooked!"
"I have thoroughly enjoyed the program, and will be looking forward to season 2.I did like the fact that the episodes were longer, but it's frustrating sometimes if you binged watch, as you end up missing the odd bit because my attention is not long enough for that.It is quite a gorey animation, and probably not for those expecting a casual watch, it can be quite shocking and intense. It is your typical animated superhero show outside of that.I feel that the show is missing something though, I found it lacking the humour element as it is aimed at an adult generation, but had very much teen/child humour. I do like the characters, but I feel their relationships did not getting stronger the longer I watched, everyone felt like acquaintances rather than best friends/ mother son.Mark seemed like a very normal teenager, tall, attractive, but they make him out like he has no friends, and had never had a girlfriend. And then all of a sudden the hottest girls in school like him.When compared to action animes such as OPM, you can see the reason why this won't have a cult following, it generally feels quite lifeless and I couldn't watch over and over again."
The show seems like it was written by a teenage that just hit puberty. Woke dialogue and troupes make the show difficult to watch.
I'm Iranian so i don't have good writing.This movie is good for that who like super heroes character. But it's super heroes were copy from DC's heroes.
For a guy who's really picky and close minded when it comes to shows especially animated shows this is one of the if not the best show I've ever watched so far unless they murder the 2nd and 3rd season. But even then it's still in my top 10. Hopefully there's animated shows like this that can occupy me until the 2nd season comes out. The plot makes sense but at the same time the characters are unpredictable in a good way. They did a wonderful job at making Omni mans heel turn not confusing to the viewers and the actors of course are wonderful. They also really make it clear that this is not a kids show because some of the things that Omni man say are kinda messed up and the violence is like off the chain so parents hide this show from your children.
"Absolutely phenomenal series. I love the story line, the episodes are an amazing length, action packed, and I love the gore."
"This was one of my favorite newly discovered series in 2021. The animation, story, and cast is fantastic. I am a big fan of The Boys, and this series carries that kind of intensity with less raunchy scenes, less sexual behavior, and some heroes with heart who sincerely try to do good in the world. For new watchers, watch the entire first episode because a twist happens in the final moments which completely changes tone of the series. I am looking forward to the next season!"
Started off like a common Superhero show but eventually it became unique in the extraordinary detail of the world it creates . Waiting for the next season!!!
"Wow...that was a hell of a ride, never a dull moment, intense, fast-paced action...just, FUN !!!I had no expectations since I didn't know the comics...something I fully intend to correct ASAP.I don't mean to spoil anything so I just have to recommend the viewing of the show...NOW!!!"
"I'm not usually a big fan of animated series, but 'Invincible' is a real revelation for me. This animated series captured my heart with its gripping story that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of animation and the depth of the characters.'Invincible' is not just a cartoon ; it has an intriguing plot that captivates viewers of all ages. This series makes you think about moral dilemmas and the importance of family relationships, and it offers quite unexpected plot twists that leave the viewer on the edge of their seat.I highly recommend 'Invincible' as an excellent choice for anyone who appreciates quality animation and an engaging storyline. This animated series is sure to captivate you and won't let go until the last episode!"
"Some of the animation is great while most of it is amateur. The dialog seems to be written by a teenager. The motivations of Omniman is far fetched. I heard that in the original comic book that he has a redemption arc which is beyond stupid. You can't come back from being a sadistic murderer and narcissist in any rational universe. The rest of the plot is derivative of better stories in the genre. The teen high school side drama was so cringe. The only people that I can see who would enjoy this show would be impressionable teen boys. This is not a good thing because the show demonstrates that ""might make right"" and ""the ends justifies the means"", a horrific take on morality. I still watched the whole season and enjoyed some of the fight scenes but I can't recommend it."
"Ever since Season 1 of this show it was so good to watch but I realized so much things about this show is that you can feel so much pain and cause of humanity that happen around the place.From The last episode of Season 1 their was scene it was inspiring for myself. Their one quote that is so inspiring like this line ""why did make me do this your fighting so you can watch everyone around you die, Think mark! You live to see this world crumble to dust and blow away everyone and everything you would be gone"" This line is so painful to hear on what Omni man said to invincible for so many years. I have heard this line so much to be heard on what they said.Season 2 Awesome and Season 1 It's Good."
"The animation and soundtrack is gem and the story is amazing, the humour and gags were awesome and the teenagers stuff was fun, the action was badass the amount of blood split is Epic, the twists right from the 1st episode were surprising and each and every character were amazingly written, The ending was Thrillingly satisfying and can't wait for another epic season!"
"Amazon prime, you've done it again. Another hit series about hypocritical superheroes and moral choices. In short, Invincible can be described as ""The Boys on steroids"". The Boys was already very impressive but this pushes the envelope even further and creates a gloriously fun experience with lots of violence, good voice acting and tremendous animation! Lewis, Goggins and Oh are doing a fantastic job as voice actors and never disappoint. The violence is quite shocking in the beginning but ""you'll get used to it"". Honestly, i believe that the level of violence in this show helps with the plot as well. For example, the villains feel very scary because you expect a lot of violence with each and every fight. The coming of age story could have been shorter because that's the only time the show feels slow. Otherwise it's a miraculous show and everyone should watch it..... Everyone who's old enough.....!"
You should really watch this show for its action but the relationship these character have is a bit to bland.
I literally haven't enjoyed something that much since like game of thrones season 4. No words can describe how incredible this was.
Invicible is great aspect about super powers and being a super hero it show may point of viewes which never reveald in superhero movie . But the drawing and the animeshon was so normal and in some scenes it was bad i hope it gets better next seasones and especially in the wide shots and scenes. I so recomnd any body to watch it before it get spoilt .
"I rarely watch superhero stuff, but man, this breaks the streotypical superheros that everything is rosy in the garden and show some brutal scenes, well-developed characters, more human and realistic, show the real consequences of the superpowers.For me, it's a MUST WATCH."
"I'm lovin'it, lovin'it, LOVEIN'IT, I'm lovin'it like.......... DOOM MUSIC KICKS IN!!!!!Who else wants Conquest to destroy the haters!!!!Role on next season!"
The comic came out in the early 2000's and it was something rarely seen before. Sadly the adaptation onto the small screen came much too late. At this point superheroes being corrupt or less than we view them has been done time and time again. This is just the latest in a genre that has been beaten to death long after the five minutes it was fun and cool.
This is a solid super hero show . I never really liked this kind of animation graphics but i was sucked in. It's one of my favorite animations ever.
"My son has been trying to get me to watch this show for a couple of years now, and I've always said....""Maybe one day.""..... Until now.....WOW!! I am extremely impressed with what I've seen so far which is all of season 1 and part of season 2. I've been binging since yesterday and can't pull myself away! My husband thinks I'm crazy but he honestly doesn't know what he's missing. I also watch The Boys which is another amazing show but Invincible is even better! I can't even tell you anything specific as to why I love it so much. So to the skeptics out there.....Give this a chance. You won't regret it!"
I have nothing to say about it honestly.Just watch it and enjoy it.
"New to the overall series and I have to say this show exceeded my expectations,
Incredible writingbrutalemotionally heavyEverything the superhero genre is too afraid to show, don't sleep on this one!"
This is actually my best cartoon TV show ryt now enjoyed every time with the movie.. Topnotch performance.
Last 2 episodes makes me feel high woouw thank you its very real and true keep gooing guys you are great woouw.
I watched Season 1 all the way until the end based on all the good reviews and that everyone said there were great surprises but you can predict what is going to happen during the whole season after the first half of the first episode. The Boys (TV Show) is way better (although season 2 is moch worse than season 1). I think you can watch this with teens 15+. I don¬¥t think this is for adults in fact since it¬¥s quite childish and predictable. I think the gore isn¬¥t necessary and the show could be done with less gory details / blood spatters.
"This is a series for edgy people. So bad. No storyline, just endless garbage filled with edge plot twists. Come on man, you got to try better.Animation is decent but the constant need to be edgy throws me off. Do not waste your time on watching this."
"People are so sensitive. You're mad about history? I thought it was comical, even the girl pushed back on the fem stuff. You're so ""un-woke"" you couldn't see he made of of the super woke."
"The last episode was such a bummer. Otherwise the entire show is great except for also the Mars episode.Voice acting at its finest and episode 7 blew my mind completely. The love angle is a bit of a chore to get through but it's bearable considering the need of other dimensions to a show. I would've rated it a 10 but the finale was pathetic which is why I decided to cut one star. Totally boring finale. Had the finale been good it would be a perfect show for me. Either which way, looking forward to the next season."
"I love this show , whole music , story , characters , it fits perfectly . The best show i can watch it with family or friends is either for teenagers or adults my top 1 animated series love it. The whole atmosphere is the best i had seen so far . The views , story teling , plot twists , things u have to think about . Showing the complicated relationships betwen friends , family and most importantly with dad . It just hit so hard to watch this kind of hearth breaking story of son and dad . Watching this makes me feel closer to my father and appreciate him . Love that it doesnt have cringe new things wanna be stuf . Its finally good show not some stupid teenager show about sex drugs and empty characters . Pls dont change it now its perfect love the show and creators."
"I mean wow, this is the show I've been waiting for my whole life. If you think the issues raised in this don't affect you, then you're part of the problem. I'm a vegan, and I also have gender dysphoria, so when I see the bold choices the networks are making in regard to progressive issues, I say hell yah! Haters gon' h8 tho."
"They've done a great job of adapting the source material. Even though I'm not as familiar with this material as others, I really like what they're doing here at least the first 3 episodes.I'd like to think it's a more realistic view of a world where super heroes and villains exist. People are getting killed left and right, the kids are dealing with normal teenage issues, difficulties with relationships and having powers has consequences.If you like The Boys on Prime, you'll like this one as well."
"I really enjoyed this Invisible superheroe drama, I can't wait to watch more episodes.. it kept me my friends on toes.. we love üíò it."
"I never read the comic but after watching this series I will give it a shot. The show really caught my interest after the first episode and I really enjoyed all of its aspects. From dialogue to action, it really delivered on those parts. The voice acting was good to, J. K voicing Omni man was a pleasant suprise like his character in TLOK. The music was as good as it can get for an animated show. They had some one liners that didn't sit well with me but I rolled with those punches for the sake of the series and overall was not dissapointed of what I got. I came in not knowing anything at all about the series nor the comic and was left hungering for more."
Omni man was living in centre of a neighbourhood and no knows Nolan grayson is omni man.. What kind of logic is this!! Even he and his son both train in that neighbourhood still no one knows his identity.. I stopped watched after 2 ep this logic just gave me Headache !!!
"Like the first 4 episodes have such great pacing and writing. And I was genuinely interested in the story and was qurious as what would happen. But the climax reveal was kinda a letdown. Expected more, and there was so much more that could have been done. But XD, the father is just a supersoldier from a tiranical galactic empire. Just a generic evil empire. There was a little effort in the fathers character, but too little too late. Its just: bad man = bad, because bad man = evil. So I really liked this series, just not that wow'ed by the reveal/twist of the whole buildup.7/10: close, so close."
"The first two episodes were amazing but looks like there is a new strategy in place now that most woke shows are failing. They hook you in with BS-free, awesome storytelling, then in episode 3, it sounds like one those people with ""PHD"" in Intersectionality and PC-Culture takes over. It's absurd. Why would you go that route. I mean, dropping this show is so easy for me if that's the direction for the future episodes. Good luck!"
"Literally one of those CW generic hero Tv shows but animated and has blood in it. That's it, generic cast with generic plot. I thought Amazon was good at redefining superheroes after The boys, I was wrong."
"So far great show. I love comic heroes, especially when they throw in teen problems growing up."
"It's super. Almost all characters are interesting, nothing
feels like filler (even some things that are). Violence is really disturbing sometimes and that's very cool. Nothing more to say, it's really a fresh thing for me."
"Invincible is great but, seriously consider the warning the show gives you about graphic content. My gf had a ptsd induced panic attack from the first episode. Only watch if you are desensitized, seriously."
If you love super heros and love violence blood gore and staright up distrouction this is the animation for you with plot twist that make you feel like you should have had a V8 moment in a good way . It may start off slow but it builds to a epic foundation this has longevity and is a breath of fresh air in this politically correct world . I give it a 10/ 10 hell if I could make the stars go golden and add 1 I would .
Its a great mature superhero show. It is both faithful while adding and improving the story from the comics.
"I'm a big fan of the superhero genre and have always given things a watch, some excellent, some good, some not so good. Invincible is right up there with the excellent contenders. Original, surprisingly adult in its plot twists and turns, some graphic scenes but the story is bubbling quite nicely. It's definitely worth it if you're into the superhero genre, for a cartoon it's excellent."
"At first i thought its just a cartoon... why shud i watch cartoon as series. But believe me i just....dont know i lost it and started watching and not taking ssly....but ryt after 15 mins things started got interesting....and completed the whole season..
You wont regret it.... eagerly waiting for more of one of these..."
"Watch this, it is visually, storywise and emotionally an extremely compelling story!"
"A lot of people are excited about this show, and with the success of The Boys, another superhero sendup from the same producers on the same streaming service, I can't help but view this as the inferior. Granted, when the comic came out, the idea of an ""evil Superman"" story was fairly novel, but given how often this has been explored, it all feels fairly generic. The Boys benefits from being a sharp satire of politics and celebrity culture, so what is Invincible saying about comics/culture?Overall, the story is a two-dimensional pastiche of comic tropes that are presented with a straight face instead of any subversion of the genre. The animation is fine, if a little bland, and the main draw seems to be the hyper-violence in lieu of compelling drama. I don't care about these characters, their relationships, or whatever growth they experience since there's nothing going on beneath the surface. I can't wait for the next season of The Boys, I see no reason to keep up with Invincible."
"I get the hype around this show. The storyline is very very good and not so predictable as well. Animation is great, the only thing that I felt could've been better was if they actually put some effort into designing the characters. You'd end up realising the similarity between the concept of omni man and superman, and this would extend to other characters as well. Would have rated it 10/10 if the characters would've been something unique. Nonetheless, I get that it's hard to come up with a strong persona to play as a hero, and thus definitely recommend watching it if you enjoy superhero theme, there are not a lot of shows out there that keep me hooked for this long."
"This is an absolutely Amazing show, It is so well written and it keeps you hooked and interested in their Universe, It also is one of the best Animated shows of all time. DO NOT MISS THIS !!"
"With a well made script, Invencible is an engaging story. Well constructed characters and amazing credit scenes leads the viwer to keep guessing what's happening, with a good dose of humor."
"Honestly, I didn't expect it to be this good.The whole TV Series has so many emotions & conflicts involved in it, child & parents husband & wife, boyfriend & girlfriend, how people trust each other how they get betrayed. It is pretty interesting till the end of the series. Most of all, they managed to hide the biggest secret of Omni-Man till the last episode."
Sooo gooood. Kwksskkssjsjjssjjsjsjsjs jdjdjejwjshsjshshdhdhd.
"As a lover of anything to do with comics or cartoons in anyway, I thought this was amazing, a bit long at times and the animation was not great at some parts,but oh boy did that make up for the fight scenes, overall really enjoyable."
"Not to mention the crazy action, violence, etc. Left and right....it's the story that brings me back and I love it! There's another superhero show I was excited for, that's being released weekly concurrently on another platform, that's been a bit of a let down--focusing more on politics and scattered all over the place narratively because of it (rhymes with malcom and the splinter boulder lol). This show, on the other hand has great characters, an amazing plot and storyline. Well done!"
"Thot it was a kids show from the thumbnail so I didn't watch for a bit, but when I saw the imdb rating & MA warning I realized, it obviously isn't a kids show. Then from episode 1,I was hooked & enjoyed binging! Hated waiting for the last few eps. Really hating to see that trend come back on streaming services we pay extra for every month, especially w how little gets released lately (all thanks to Disney & The Mandalorian, so now other platforms are following suit) anyway... Steven yuen is awesome +Andrew rannells, gillian jacobs, Jason mantzoukas (who Def sounds more like his animated teenage character than his 40+yo irl) they're all super funny & some of my fav comedic actors Inc Walton Goggins. Not to mention Mahershala ali, WTF? Since when do Oscar winners do voice overs on animated series... (ya, it's that good)!! Just wish the season was twice as long! Hopefully s02 is already well in the works & releases asap."
"This is a very good show at the new things it brings to the table, like the father son aspect and Omni Man's backstory, and the infamous part of the final episode. Where I see issues are the things with Mark's time scheduling issues, and a lot of stuff that's just been done so many times before, Mark and Robin from Teen Titans are very similar characters, the character designs feel uninspired, especially the original guardians of the globe, every single one of them is just another character you've seen before with some minor changes.Back to the time scheduling thing. It just didn't make much sense. Mark misses a ton of things because of not having enough time for other things. It's tried to make sense by making Omni-Man also have time scheduling issues, but that only makes it make less sense because the reason Mark has issues is because he's half viltrumite, and half human, so he has to do things both species do, but Omni-Man is full viltrumite, and it feels like it makes even less sense after the ending.I did enjoy my time watching the show, and I'll most likely watch the 2nd season, but it does just feel like they took a lot of the things that worked in other superhero media and put it all together instead of trying something new, and I do like the like 2 things they try that are new, but it's like a 6 hour show with barely anything new.If you're debating watching it, give it a shot."
"This show is so well done, the character development is amazing, the plot is amazing, the twists and turns the show takes you on is amazing, the characters themselves are amazing, the action and emotion that this show will elicit out of you is amazing. This show is easily one of my fav of all times, can't wait for season 2. I watched the whole first season in one night from start to finish, I could not get enough. 10/10 must watch."
"I just finished season 1 and I want to see more. Haven't seen this much action packed thrilling story in a while. I love how there is so much content in the story, they don't take forever to make a move and we'll its really good."
"Amazing show, just all is perfect, the story ,animation ,characters, truly great show
Cant wait for season 2."
I think is one of the best animated series so far I really hope they continue making the series for other seasons.
"Damn Invincible is amazing! It was extremely entertaining and never felt slow. Steven Yuen and J. K. Simons really stood out in this show, and they gave some of the best performances in their career. The gore factor just made this show perfect! Easy 10/10 for any comic book lover."
That's all I have to say. Animated version of The Boys.
"For those that don't give this show a try, watch the first episode to the very end, and I swear you will be hooked. The art style and cast for this show is out of this world, I am Super (:D) glad this has been picked up for another 2 seasons. Amazing job and the source material is great as well."
"Positives. Cool Action-Sequences
. The Emotional scenes somewhat work
. Great character development
. Love the animation personally
. Great Acting, with an ok script
. Nice Relationship and dynamic between the father and the sonNegatives. Uninteresting first few minutes, I felt that it was unnecessary
. To much Gore, which wasn't needed."
"I'm disappointed to say it but I didn't really enjoyed it. The series has potential but it takes more than potential to make a good superhero story. In my experience watching it , I noticed how stale and almost clich√© the scenes go and there's a little too less of work done to some filler and main characters that didn't really made me care about them. I'm not gonna lie it had some pretty cool fight scenes in it but those didn't made me feel satisfied or okay to just disregard it's flaws. The voice acting was alright , the animation's art style was fine , the plot was interesting but it could've been better. There are some things the story didn't explain and left me wondering like for example , on the first episode where there's a fight between cops and a cyborg of some sort and why didn't the other corner of cops didn't chose the right action and retreat after knowing that the enemy is impenetrable by bullets? It just doesn't seem logical. How does the heroes and villain's powers work? It must've been explained in the comics but why didn't they bother showing it in the animated series? Why did Cecil wasted lives and weapons on Omniman in the last episode? My point is that there are scenes that they could've constructed better and watching through those scenes are disappointing and didn't made any sense. A lot more I could say but yeah , sucks."
I simply love this show it's beyond what I expected.
"So good, I feel like there should be 20+ shows like this & I really do hope they go full on with this project & keep the pacing up too. I only read a few issues back in the mid 00s but this has me wanting to go back & read everything. I have to admit that I wish it had more frames generally , there have been a few sequences where the amount of fps have been increased & it's way more fluid & carries more weight, but I also understand the effort needed to accomplish this is intensive & not really viable yet consistently, either way I want at least 20yrs of this üî•ü§£üñ§"
I am waiting for all the seasons. World building is on another level.
I was not excepting this show to be as good as it is. I thought that it was just going to be another animated super hero show but man am i amazed. The action is on point the story is good and it even makes you care about the characters. This needs a season 2.
It's always a possibility what if superman goes rogue?This series will show this exact theme in a more appropriate way. It shows us the dark side of the superhero universe.
"What a show, 100% worth a watch. That about sums up my review but apparently imdb wants this to be longer."
They need to make more animated content like this!
"Yes it's bloody and gruesome. Just like that comic thankfully. The animation mimics the comic. I was pretty surprised that they stayed with it.The voice actors are top notch. The biggest hit for me it wedging the woki stuff in that wasn't in the book. By the end I was just skipping any scene with Amber in it. The character's reason for even existing in Mark's life makes little sense, and skipping scenes with her doesn't impact the narrative in the slightest. She exists simply to be morally superior or outraged, depending on the time of day. I'm sure that when it comes time for Invincible and Atom Eve to become a couple we'll find out she's decided to become nonbinary too. So a couple of stars off for the pandering."
"Good show , keeping wanting more. Looking forward to the next season."
I really hope they can make several seasons of this series. This is an awesome story with big name actors. Definitely my new favorite animated series!
"Loved it... Great story great animation , i was hooked man...wow wow wow."
I didn't know this is based off the comics but watching this series this is so enjoyable animation looks amazing the dialogue and story is so cool.Mark is easily one of most likeable main character in the series even the supporting characters they are each memorable.If you haven't seen it I recommend you watch this series its fun to watch.I can't wait for season 2.
"An outstanding show. The voice acting is superb. The writing is very good and characters are engaging and personable. Many complain about the gore, violence and language but this show has a mature rating for a reason. This show is NOT for kids. While there is a sprinkle of wokeness it is not heavy handed and does not interfere with the overall story."
I thought the show and the plot was really good and the gore and animation was amazing and the last episode I liked really well to set up the next season but the only thing I didn't like was the animation being either really good or bad like comparing Omni man blowing up the alien planet looking amazing in animation but compared to the flying scenes where it was the same animation but just dragging mark across the screen was eh.
Watched one episode then binged the rest. A mix of everything and it all binds together very effectively.. Stop reading this and watch now!
Really enjoyed this series. Faithful to the comics with a great cast. Binge watched it all. Enjoyed it so much I was gutted it was only 8 episodes. Lots of stories to tell though as the comics ran for many years.
"Finally some exploration in what powers can do to values , a breath of fresh air !! Can't wait to continue the journey of Invincible!!!!"
"""Spider-Man: The Animated Series""(or some good from DC)+""The Boys"".I definitely love it. And what a casting - creators have not wasted their money.P. S. Never use 3D graphics anymore pls."
Watched the first 3 episodes. Good fighting scenes and interesting plot but character development is a bit off. Overall story seems rushed with some cliche one liners. Animation wise it's not a masterpiece either but is definitely watchable.
"The sharp unexpected plot, effectively paced story development , and vicious fights, makes this must see tv. Just imagine a rated R #justiceleague or #youngjustice. Omni Man might be the #1 worst dad in animated history. ( Goku is a strong 2nd tho üëÄ)Expect a lot of blood and explicit content as it is listed rated TV- MA. You can catch it on #Amazonprime, and it's only 8 episodes. In addition according to #fandom #invincible has been renewed for season 2 and 3. Yay!Verdict: 9/10
If you enjoy animated series, a convincing story and gruesome unpredictable fights, then you must watch this show! It's comparable to many #animes with its blood splatter. Would we consider this an anime ? üëÄ What would you rate #invincibleamazon ?"
"From the music, the cast, the relatable characters and the frickin' AWESOME action scenes, Invincible has got it all and can be argued to be one of the best cartoon shows ever! It gives you a character (Mark Grayson) who you instantly become friends with - wanna know why? Well, lets be honest, everyone who watches this is either a fan of the comic books, Robert Kirkman or superhero movies and Tv shows etc. This means that if we could, we would probably repeat all of his action throughout the series, which creates tension for when he is in danger as we'd like to think life would be perfect as a superhero, but actually it's not. Overall, i think i can speak for most of the viewers of the show that once you start watching. You can't stop!"
This show gives us the entertainment of dc movies but enhances the entertainment with violence. The twists are unexpected and new for a superhero anime franchise. The characters become more interesting as the show goes on. Worth watching. After watching the first episode we can't hold ourselves back to watch what happens next episode and this feeling is recurring after every episode. Just watch the first episode and u can't resist yourselves to watch the rest of it. Season 2 and 3 have been announced. Can't wait to watch them.
"Wow so refreshing and original, no marvel and Dc woke rubbish, can't wait for second series,"
"I thought for the longest time why comic book related series or movies more often than pull their punches to make something so engaging, but invincible scratches that itch which so many shows try to do. It's well animated, has a great phase and growing stakes, well timed dark humor and likeable characters. While the plot might seem like something you've seen a million times, this show does things so differently that it manages to stand out, and ooh boy does it stand out. I'm looking forward to Season 2, this is some of the best superhero series I've seen, if not the best in so many years.It deserves all the praise, love it!"
After watching the first episode could not stop 5 episodes in and I'm wanting more. Great cast. And love the premise.
I went in thinking there was no way this could be good. Now it is one of my favorite shows.
"Realism is something that usually lacks in animated series, and that's unfortunate. Individuals inventing out of the world tech that puts the governments to shame? Fine once, fine twice, fine thrice, but 100x times?Too much to complain about, not enough energy to do so.I loved the brutality, but that's about the best part of this series."
"For those who used to watch Japanese animation, you should know that Netflix animation is trivial to what you have been watching before, nothing.8=4."
"I never heard anything about this show (or comic) other then the premise before watching this. I was not disappointed in the show. Wonderful action, great plot, interesting characters, really worth the watch. Only problem that I have is the animation is not always great for when the characters are not fighting, but when they are it makes up for that."
Brutal!!! Lots of blood and of course captivating plot.
"No spoilers. This show is fantastic, I am a long time fan of the comic the show is based on and there are some changes made but I don't mind them. None are so large they break the story of the show. The animation is fantastic, fight scenes look amazing and the voice acting is top notch. Can't wait for the next season."
A must watch even if you are not a big superhero fan!
"I need more seasons !!!It's so wonderful , cool, awesome,that i can't wait for the second season."
"Morbid, brutal, dark and very entertaining. This show isn't for kids but that is probably it's only shortcoming. Highly recommended."
"At last, a superhero caper that is nothing like Marvel or DC.Characters are amazing, complicated, sympathetic and larger than life.Excellent storyline, with the potential for much much more.Great actor lineup.Cannot wait for season 2!"
This show is great. Honestly I forget it's animated.Totally sucks you in.
"The entire season is based on one question.Why did omni man go rogue?The answer is, spoiler alert, he has been rogue for a very long time.Also, there are teenage drama and random people doing random stuff."
"After a stunning s1 it saddens me to write this, found this show completely unwatchable but stayed through because I liked s1 and I had high hopes and excpectations it would lead to something but it didn't. This snoozefest of a chite show is so boring it gave me a lasting headache after 4 eps of this trash. Really a shame the first s was so promising and it was great. S2 I still excpected a superhero show but got this lame and exaggerated unnecesserily stretched out and never ending soapy goo instead. It tries to force you to be invested but fails greatly with the dull writing. Do yourself a favour and don't watch it save your time and spare yourself from this astronomical drop in quality s1 is a 9 s2 is a rock sollid 1 way to ruin the show."
"Invincible is one of the best series ever released, this series is without a doubt a treasure in the animation industryIt's very hard to find good superhero series but invincible is worth itThe series follows the story of Mark Grayson, a teenager who develops superhuman abilities and decides to follow in his father's footsteps to become a superhero. One of the best characters is onim man he is Mark's father is an alien from the planet Viltrum . As Mark trains to become a superhero, he learns about the challenges of balancing his personal life with his superhero duties. He also discovers the dark secrets behind his father's past and his true intentions for coming to Earth.The motive of Omni-Man, is plot point in the Invincible series. In the beginning, Nolan appears to be a loving husband and father, as well as a dedicated superhero who protects Earth as a member of the Guardians of the Globe, as the series progresses, it becomes clear that Nolan has a darker motive for coming to Earth. It is eventually revealed that Nolan is actually a Viltrumite, an alien species known for their superior strength and abilities, and that his true mission on Earth is to prepare the planet for conquest by the Viltrumite EmpireWhen Mark finds out about his father onim man's true motives for coming to Earth and his involvement in various atrocities, he is devastated and struggles to come to terms with the truth. This revelation puts a significant strain on Mark's relationship with his father and causes him to question everything he thought he knew about his family and himselfA battle between the two characters then occurs. The battle begins with Omni-Man confronting Invincible and trying to convince him to join him in his mission to conquer Earth. When Invincible refuses, the fight breaks out, and the two characters engage in a brutal and destructive fight that spans across the city.Throughout the battle, both characters use their superhuman strength and abilities to try defeat each other . The fight is particularly brutal, with both characters sustaining severe injuries and causing massive destruction to their surroundingsafter these events there is the comic that continuesIn the comic series, there are several major story arcs that take place after the battle between Invincible and Omni-Man. These story arcs include:1. The Viltrumite War: This story arc follows Mark and his allies as they face off against the Viltrumites, a powerful alien race that Omni-Man was a part of. The Viltrumite War is a major turning point in the series and has significant consequences for several characters.2. The Reboot: This story arc takes place several years after the Viltrumite War and sees Mark dealing with the aftermath of his choices and the impact they have had on his life. The Reboot introduces several new characters and storylines, while also exploring the themes of legacy and the consequences of one's actions.3 .The End of All Things: This story arc is the final arc of the Invincible comic series and follows Mark as he faces his greatest challenge yet. The End of All Things features several major twists and turns, and it provides a satisfying conclusion to the series while also setting up new possibilities for the futureUnlike other superhero series likethe boysDaredevilmy hero acadeimaOne Punch ManTitansThey are also excellent seriesAnd also cinematic universes likemarvel and dcBut invincible does an amazing jobin the main characterthe charactersworld buildingthe animationthe villainsAnd the plotAll are excellent and goodoverall: Invincible is a very good series with a good plot and amazing charactersInvincible seires:(10/10)
Invincible comics:(10/10)"
Best damn superhero series for me since daredevil. I had no idea about the comics but the first episode got me hooked and it only got better. I generally don't give reviews for tv series but this show is too damn good and the writers did a fine job . Can't wait for season 2.
"I've been a huge fan of the comic series for a long time and so far this adaptation has been amazing and i honestly believe it could be better than the comic version, i love the voice cast and all the minor changes they've added from the comics.It doesn't diverge from the path, maintains the humour, epic battles and violence. I really hope this series lasts for awhile as i'll definitely be here for all of it."
"Amazing series,but on some episodes it is to violent for large public or kids in special!"
This is a great show. It's very different then other comic book shows and it's very good.
"At first in chapter one you will be impatient for the slowly drama, but before the chapter ends. All boring has been gone."
"I have nothing but love for this show, it's so unique and not even generic at all. The heroes and villains are beyond amazing.Show is 100/10 for me."
"The voice cast is outstanding. Aside from all the Walking Dead Alumni, it's fun to hear all the Guest stars dropping in for a few pivotal lines of dialogue."
Just what I fkn needed. Just fkn brilliant.Ofcourse there's room for improvment but plot wise i couldn't be any happier. Fkn brilliant.
"It's OK, but I expected more. I havn't found the characters very interesting or the story intriguing."
"8.8/10I'll kill myself, can't wait for next seasonThe series was very cool, fun, and perfect in terms of story, characters, graphics, script, even the music was great
This series made me tell myself I wish I was a superhero .An amazing series, very special, innovative, and adding the blood factor is something exceptional."
"I thought it a great show, it is very bloody serie, I appreciate adult series."
"From the very first episode to the 7th, some scenes didn't make sense. I couldn't figure out the direction the story was going because certain events occured and it didn't make sense why they occured. So the whole storyline at that point was pretty much vague to me. What kept me going was the amazing display of action and that's it. Until the last episode ( episode 8) where all the dots finally connected and the story became very clear now. It was then that I realized how good it was and how great it will become."
"This show is very faithful to the comics. The cast and the art is amazing. But this is not for children! Extreme Violence, Gore, sexual, content, profanity. No way is this meant for children but it's amazing for us big kids. I want to binge at all now but I guess I will have to wait for every Friday."
After seeing the first 3 episodes I can confidently say I'm loving it. I cried hearing all those Walking Dead Actors. Steven Yeun is incredible.
"This series has everything you need. Action, suspense, drama, emotions and humor. Was not expecting to like it but after that last scene from 1st episode, you know you want more of it. Never even heard of this superhero before but now more curious to see what they can bring on upcoming seasons."
"It's a masterpiece! It has action! Adventure! Romance, suspense and the thrill!Didn't bore me at any points. Really loved it, gives you spice of almost all genres. Very cool to watch and has many twists and turns innit which make it even more so exciting! Must watch :)"
It has a really engaging story.The animation is also nice.
"The Amber character is a such a twitter construct. She's what the delusional mob thinks a good person should be, but she comings off horribly. Can't tell if we are suppose to take he literally or tongue in cheek. She doesn't act like a real person. Either way her plot line bogs down the show. I feel like the story progression stops every time she is on screen. Other than that, it's a very good show."
The story is not really as good as ppl make it out to be. Yes there is a lot going on. But somehow it feels... boring. Like it's not a big reveal. You don't empathise with the characters. This story feels like a one of cartoon from a batman show in the 90's. Yhea fun to watch and kill some time. But the over arcing story? Mhe. I guess it's nice the adapted the story pretty well from the comic. But the comic was never that populair. Maybe in the US. I don't know. But not over here in the EU. And it is clear why. Also the supposed power Omniman should have seems to be weak and later on imensly more powerfull. Yet they should be even more powerful then that. They just keep switching up the powerlevels to what would be interesting instead of what they should be. You can't have some one be strong enough to withstand a orbital laser blast and just be a little dirty. But cough up blood from a powerfull punch not even half the power of that laser.
"So far so good. Kinda anime ""the boys"" approach, with life like experiences and problems, relationships, powers and issues, with a big plot running behind the scenes."
This series is great gives a touch of realism better than the DC and MARVEL animated series and movies Hopefully they keep giving more stories and it's not just these eight episodes Because sometimes the good is little and sometimes the boring a lot It offers us a respite from the typical well-known superhero stories Bravo to those who created it.
Was hooked from episode one. Keep it going. The future of superhero comics!
I've been a fan of the Invincible comic since forever. I'm considering giving it a second reading because these 3 first episodes absolutely blew my mind and the excitement is too much!!! Great adaptation. Fantastic animation. Phenomenal voice acting. Ultraviolent action. This is easily the best animated series right now. Can't wait for the next episodes.
"This is a very interesting and intense cartoon. I loved all the storylines and how Mark tries to become a superhero like his dad. I enjoyed all the tense moments in the series, despite the fact that it sometimes feels like it has a stretched plot at times. But I didn't like that the background is often empty. No, the animation is good, but the background is often empty and static. In my opinion, I like when the background is as active as the characters. The characters are nicely fleshed out, but I never understood (no spoilers) why Omni man did that. But I liked everything. Thanks for this work!"
"I love it. Awesome voice cast, good action, mysterious plot and excellent animation. Invincible checks all the boxes for a great animated series. I can't wait to see what comes next."
"May start out and look like a family friendly show, but IT IS NOT, just a warning for those that aren't aware that this series is definitely adult."
"One of my favorite show from amazon prime originals. The story was great, not the typical superhero team up show, the voice actors were great too. After Boys, this is another superhero show which gave us great content. I think amazon prime is giving us some great content to watch.The animation is ok, if you are expecting some MAPPA level animation then you will be disappointed. But the story and the voice acting makes up for everything in the show. It is binge worthy."
"Boiss its dope just watch and u gonna get entertained and stunned for good 5-6hrs. Amazon has been really killing with superhero stuff, firstly with THE BOYS and now INVINCIBLE. The storyline is great and it doesn't bore u for a minute. It takes a lil time to set up story in ep1 but from there there's no looking back. Waiting badly for S2 AND S3."
"I expected a lot from the show since it was talked so highly upon from all different media.It was too slow at times and the ending to season 1 wasn't that exciting.I decided to catch up on the comics only to be disappointed once again, I don't want to see 10 seasons of this show only to get absolutely nothing done.Might rate higher if they change it up a bit and skip the Cliche Anime Compassion and Friendship bit."
"Do you like superheroes? Well this show will rip off every other piece of interesting superhero media, and add nothing new to the formula. It's derivative in the worst kind of way, and everything in this show has been done much better a million times over by other shows. Your time would be better spent watching paint dry."
"I'm just really confused by the budget allotment here. The writing is perfectly good, the voice-cast star-studded but what's going on with the animation?It's visibly cheap and poorly done. Over-static characters like paper marionettes with poorly-synched lip movements. Every character seems as stiff and lifeless as a background figure in an original Scooby-Doo. You'd think if you're making a cartoon, you'd prioritise the animation with at least some of the budget. It's kind of an important part."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this series, but there are many technical flaws that need to be addressed in future seasons. There are a fair number of animation errors, with 1 or 2 noticeable ones every episode. Things like characters having just their chest and above because their torso is meant to be off screen, but the cell or layer or whatever you want to call it is to high up, so you see empty space between them and the frame's edge. It feels lazy and cheap, but can be fixed fairly easily in the future."
"I am not a comic guy and don't really watch super hero stuff but this show was amazing. Just watch the first episode to the very end then decide if you want to continue. Once you know, you know.The fight scenes are long and brutal. The show has awkward and heart wrenching moments. The voice acting is exceptional.Only negative is the boring teenage boiler plate stuff. But the maincharacter is a
teenager so not much else to expect. Though most of the characters are interesting and endearing, a portion of them are just idle/boring like Rex, duplicate girl, samson. The animation budget went completely in to the fight scenes so you might notice the flying and other parts are a bit flimsy/choppy."
"On episode 7 and this is outstanding. Totally gripping and Immersive. I stepped away from comics just before this was released so I have no clue on the story. It stands head & shoulders above ""The boys"", most of the MCU which is my great love and don't get me started on the DCU.Can wait for the conclusion and hope there is loads more story content for the future."
"Before I go on, I have to say this show is AWESOME! While the first episode may be a bit generic, once you get the ending, it becomes a no holds bar type of show that really tells a different side to an overcrowded superhero space. My only criticism would be that the animation feels a bit janky at times but if they fix that, this is definitely a 10/10 must see superhero show!"
I never read the comics. This is one of the best shows I have ever seen. I love how the animation calls back to the classic Batman. The story is really really good. The script is excellent. The acting great. Like not sure what else you want people. How can you say the story is boring or simple. FML though now I need to wait for the next season.
Great show great cast. Dark story but not to dark. Very enjoyable dialogue between each of the characters.
"Having never heard of the comics or their assumed legendary status, I had no idea what to expect. Wasn't a big fan of the animation style initially (I'm used to watching high quality Japanese stuff and the Disney - Pixar kind) but boy was it to be trivial complaint lost in the depths of my mind. The story started off being foreign to me, like I said I didn't know what to expect, the heroes appeared to clear clich√©s or almost a straight rip-off the various Marvel, DC heroes so I thought I was heading for a major cringe filled disappointment but man the ending of that first episode caught me so off-guard and just basically set up the entire show for me. I haven't seen too many more thrilling things than this, it had me on the of my seat throughout. The comedy, the action, the suspense, all absolutely spot on!! I took off one star only because I wasn't a big fan of the Mars episode (seemed like a basic filler to me, i could be wrong though)"
"A bit of Big Mouth energy sneaks in with one of that show's voice actors that lowers the tone.Twisty for the sake of being twisty sometimes. Oh he's a bad guy now. Oh and that guy too.It has good moments but most of the runtime feels like generic filler.Lot of people comparing it to The Boys, yes it has a bad superhero but it lacks the humanity and struggle of The Boys themselves so there's no tension. For an animation aimed towards adults it could have gone darker and most of time it feels childish.The evil Superman stunt was pulled in the last moments of the first episode and all his actions after the convenient coma bought them some time have been vague, giving no sense whatsoever about his motivations which is unsatisfactory for what I assume is the main storyline for the season."
"If you like superheroes fighting and blasting stuff you'll love this. It's the same superhero stuff that's been cranked out for decades. Maybe slightly above average. It is NOT like The Boys, which has something to say and has some complexity. This is just straight up wish fulfillment/fantasy fighting stuff.Judging from the other reviews if you like that kind of stuff you'll love this. I don't think most casual viewers or people who like some depth to their entertainment will however."
"I don't know what took me so long to find and watch this show, I discovered it from the memes, lol. Things I like about this show so far:I can actually relate to what Omni-Man is saying about humanity. He makes a good villain and I agree with him that we are hell bent on destroying ourselves. But I didn't like that he compared his wife to a pet, like yeesh, so that makes me also dislike him, but in the end he can't bring himself to kill his son and flies away in tears, so maybe he does have some redeeming qualities after all.You can really feel for Invincible, he pretty much lost his father, someone he thought he knew and could trust. He had been lied to all of his life.Things I didn't like:Way too much action for my taste, it seems like there was just constant conflict and fighting and that it made it seem very unrealistic. If it weren't for this, I'd give it 10 stars.How did they get to the moon so fast, that doesn't make any sense, even if he's a super hero? Same with Mars, unless they discovered close to light speed travel, getting there in just two weeks is nonsensical with rocket boosters or whatever.Other than my two main gripes with the show, it's still a very good and interesting show."
This show is dark af but it is so very good. I ALSO CANT WAIT FOR SEASONS 2 and 3 üòÅ. This show is fantastic except for amber I'm sorry she was one of my favorites and then she was kind of a bi**h and then put them back together in the end just no I can't with that butbthats the only down side and that was in the end so it is fantastic all together ‚ù§
"Invincible is amazing and highly recommended to everyone even if you aren't a fan of superhero stuff because this isn't just that, It has alot of drama and mystery in-between all the fighting which isn't stale or boring at all. Honestly this show has some of the most consistently great fight scenes out there. And to top all of that the characters are superb (haha get it?) And their motivations make sense and don't feel like they're doing things just for the plot."
This show was so good every episode kept me wanting to keep watching.
"Really enjoyed the first season and looking forward to the second. Great cast for the voices as well and nice story twists. In its core it is a modern American version of Dragon Ball Z, so nothing completely new. But hey, better make a good copy than a bad own show."
"I really enjoyed the first season and can't wait for the second. Excellent and memorable characters and their VA, it is brutal and brutally entertaining. Interesting take on the superhero genre, I finished the season in one day. Only thing that bothered me slightly is forced inclusion. Great father - son dynamics.All in all, a must watch!"
"Everything about this show is powerful! The voice acting is great, the characters are fascinating, and the story is incredible! I'm not really into animated stuff, so it takes a lot for me to get hooked on something, but with Invincible, it was easy! I can't wait for season two."
"I¬¥m a guy that NEVER got the time to watch series, I saw the first episode, and now I¬¥m stuck. The job can wait xD."
"Season 2 = Some amber issues + lots of useless side character information. We just want to see superhero thing not the human life or whatever. Furthermore when anissa explains mark why he must choose viltrumite she is totally right you cant argue with her.if her people come to earth everyone will be happy . There will be no illness,famine... and anyway mark is just being stupid . Lets talk about another anomaly why we must hear amber's idiotic thoughts. I mean your boyfriend just saving earth and you say you don't spend time with me anymore. You should be greatful i mean he is solid superhero ..."
"Just need to watch 2st episode to see the potential.......
The massacre shown and the bleeding we see is little more logical and real than any other universe......It touches the heart.......
This last 2 episodessssss wowww...."
"I dont why some people really rating tis very dump..Actually tis s outta of world kepps u engaged and enthralled in each episode ...
Some bloody action loaded pile of scenes gives an impression for action lovers...
If you want some bloody scavenging fill up action then u gotta pave a way to watch it ....must watch show..üòé"
"This series totally deserves to be made with real actors and VFX like that of marvel movies.Literally enjoyed every minute although I don't like animated series that much, Just watch it, Story is at par, And oh man the voice actors are just awesome üèÖ.Watch It ASAP."
"As a big fan of superhero movies, I watched many Marvel's and DC's movies, including anime movies, and still seeking for more. Comics, animations, and TV shows. Some of them are incredible, like Batman: dark knight return, or The Boys. And my requests become more, or should I say, more critical. Only has some excellent SFXs but no good characters or stories, I still won't be satisfied, even though I know most of them are totally commercial movies and maybe I shouldn't request more.I like The boys so much. I never believed all those super 'heroes' have a higher moral level or are perfect. Sure, there definitely have some 'god-like' heroes, but in my mind, most of them are just normals with power, nothing more. I like the way The boys pull the 'gods' down, even kill them, I also appreciate its creative story.But honestly, when the impact of this show faded, I couldn't say I like the story so much. The design, yes, but the story and the characters, well, not so much. I realised I'm seeking for more.And now, Invincible comes to me.There are 2 types of story I love. One is 'the boy meets the girl' type, and one is 'a young grow up in his/her adventure'. Obviously, Invincible belongs to the type 2. I like the way Mark gets his power, trying to fight with criminals, and finally made a mess on his school, dream, and love. That is really terrible but, also makes me feel so real. And the relationship between Eve, Amber and Mark also makes me comfortable, and including Debby, all female characters are so amazing.The 'I still have you, dad' really touched me.Can't wait for the season 2."
"Animated drama at its best, great acting, beautifully drawn, great story, great characters it has it all really. If you love superhero stuff you will love this simple as."
"Invincible is a comic book by the legendary writer Robert Kirkman.In 2021 it was adapted into the best animated series the world has ever seen.THE GORE, THE ACTION, THE DRAMA, SO MUCH FUN.The ultimate wtf show."
"This is basically what would happen if you mixed Justice League with The Boys... really enjoyable, great cast and good animation. The fact it is animated helps massively as the budget would be too big for live action, so don't let that put you off."
It's so messed up and so great at the same time. Really keeps you on your toes and makes you question everything you think you know about a standard super hero story formula. Not predictable at all. Can't wait for season 2!
"I watched Invincible because I've been hearing about the buzz for weeks now on social media and I looked at the reviews on IMBD thinking this show must really be amazing, and it isn't. It's alright."
"The animation in this TV show is adequate, but nothing special. Voice talents are adequate. Plot is extremely thin and meager. Characters are flat and way underdeveloped. Feels like characters are cardboard counterfeits of some of DC universe characters. The first time the graphic violence happens it is shocking, after that it becomes so routine that it gets to the point of ludicrousness. I stopped washing after a few episodes because of the poor writing. Seems like a lot of political agenda is forced into the series as well. I do not recommend this show."
"Jesus man, this show is such a banger of superhero show with some awesome twists that just aren't seen of they even got every single actor/actress you can think of too!"
"10/10
what a masterpiece series
never ever expected that
good thing they announced two more seasons
they actually showed gore scenes and it was the best thing along with story and characters. Ending is also mind-blowing.You are in a ride for this guys.Don't miss it!"
"I am so blew away by the plot, twist, action and artworks. Everything about this animation series is just superb and not to forget about the tracks which were clearly the depicts every scene perfectly. This is clearly the best action packed animation series ever made. Eagerly waiting for season 2."
One of the finest and very gripping narrative of this series. Invincible is have one of the best animation and the fight sequences are very well animated. After death note the best anime I have ever seen.
I'm so surprised because. I never thought I would like an overhyped show it was so shocking for me excuse the stupid old me and also excuse me for using the word overhyped for the show the characters'animation'fights and the best one the relationship between the family ' I wish if icould erase my memory to rewatch it ugh.
"Great animation and Voice Acting, wish there was little Amber and more Eve and The Guardians, the relationship between Mark and Amber seems off and the writers did not know what to do with her I liked Mauler Twins more than here at least They have a purpose. Episode 6 was way step down for the series's as boring but hey it's just one episode:)"
"Just after finishing The Boys I started looking for shows with kinda similar theme and then i cam to know about this great show named ""Invincible"". Just give it a shot!!!"
It is the best but you can add more violence.you can also add a better graphics and add more characters.
"Unlike the marvels and dcs we are used to, Its different,More real in terms of stacks and casualties,I hope it gets even more interesting as we progress to new episodes and seasons."
"This review is based only on Episode 1. Overall, that episode was only OK. The cast is great and the strength of the show, even many small parts are voiced by well known actors. Unfortunately, that is undermined by two large negatives. First, the pacing is slack and bloated, using 45 minutes to tell a story that would have been better told in roughly 30 minutes. Second, the animation is just disappointing, far closer to Saturday morning kids' cartoons than a high profile streaming show with an A-list cast. Also, unlike most Prime Video originals, Invincible is ""only"" presented in HD rather than 4K and HDR. I know that last sentence shows how we've been spoiled, but there's no getting around the fact that in today's TV climate, the show looks drab. (Maybe this is an animation thing; while Netflix' Disenchantment was in 4K it was not in HDR like almost all Netflix originals. Still, it looked far nicer than Invincible.)"
It's the best type of movie/ Web-Serise whatever you call. It's not like cartoon.It shows how actually people die.Not like other superhero movies it's the best one.
"Well written story and incredible soundtracks.Characters are excellent
Another good thing that the used the old style drawings."
"This is awesome. I have watched a lot of series of this genre, this one is just blowing my mind. No wonder this is breaking the internet. JK Simmons you beauty."
"Having not read the comics I didn't know what to expect from this. From watching the first trailer I would of compared it to an animated, more mature version of Amazons The Boys. After the first episode I was blown away. Just everything about it was amazing (story, gore, characters, cast). A couple of episodes could of been better with their stories and action but overall this is just a brilliant series and can't wait for the next one!"
I love this show so much because it's introduce a new character to the dc world.
"Wow! This was the most addictive show I have seen for awhile. I think your fans of Rick and Morty and Love death and robots would enjoy this. My partner and I watched it in one night, really dramatic. It reminded me of the boys, which we also love. I would recommend it."
"Simply incredible. I watched the whole first season in one day. The storyline, the voice acting, the style...all of it worked so well together. I was almost questioning why so many people were raving over it until the final scene of the first episode, and then I was hooked. Can't wait to watch it again!"
A good story but too many unnecessary characters.Wouldn't give it anymore than a 7.
"I was definitely excited about this series and definitely love ""almost"" anything superhero.Aside from the fact you can easily see where the writer gleaned his ideas from (hasn't the JLA rep suffered enough?), the story seemed somewhat promising.That is until you get to the gore, which is A LOT.I really don't want to go into details because of spoilers, but simply out the gore overpowers the overall story that even the best story cannot contain.Now again, to each their own.But if we have to rely on ""shock and awe"" rather than strong storytelling to hold a series then we need to revisit the basics and see why so many fans like these heroes in the first place.To make the world better than is was before they arrived.What's that saying about ""with great power"" again...??"
"Few shows have a believable take on what would happen if superheroes existed and used their powers. Invincible does a great job at that, especially when it comes to collateral damage.The show is enjoyable and can be quite fun at times, if you can ignore the low quality animation, woke messaging and skip the high-school drama parts."
"An amazing supehero animated show, with lot of violence and a great plot, Invincibe is a show that everybody should watch.I already knew about the existence of Invincible, but I never would have thought that it would be such a great show.Invincible talks about a teen who have a father who is the most powerful superhero on earth, and how this teen, Mark Grayson(voiced by Steven Yeun) deal with his superpowers and his social life. But don't think that it's just that, the show has some great plot twists, that make it even better.The animation of the show is also really great, with some awesome actions scene that really makes you feel imersed in the show.You should really watch Invincible if you like superhero shows, with great plot twists, a amazing animation and a awesome soundtrack."
"I had started watching simply because a friend recommended it. Normally I avoid animation although I love anything superheroes and the right thing can hit me right between the eyes - regardless of expectations - and Invincible did that like a freight train.I'm still dealing with the impact to be honest. Character development, story arc, art style and direction, pacing, emotional coherence, voice acting - all work together like finely tooled components in a high performance engine.Invincible is utterly brilliant. I need more. Season 2 is obviously a while away so meantime I'll just have to re-watch season 1.What a hardship."
This show is something else. It's starts as a normal superhero movie but it goes beyond very quickly. Must watch!
This show is a very great show even if you don't like superhero's. This show has great acting and all around is a very good standout in the superhero genre. Not trying spoil anything.
"I'm personally not a big fan of Anime shows & I don't watch. But as I do reviews on movies & series on my YouTube channel so I thought to watch Invincible & experience something different.It was an excellent show & the script was well written. It was funny, exciting, emotionally smart consist of humor, mystery, drama, romance, and science fiction.The first episode was mind-blowing. It starts with the hook & ends with the hook & that was the clever way of scriptwriting by including hooks in every episode. The shocking scenes and gore are even more detailed & suspenseful.There was too much bloody violence with a ton of great action. The animation and voice acting were too good."
"I do really enjoy watching this show, but I just can't ignore all the conveniences and inconsistencies in the plot. Some things were addressed earlier to then be different later on for no reason but to advance the story. The dialogue is fine, there are some cringeworthy moments, and a few characters are extremely annoying. Other than that, very solid show. Can't wait to finish it."
"The thing about superheros. They hit eachother for around 20 min with some stingers, hit harder until someone falls through a building. These action scenes we already saw in Dragon Ball Z. So come up with something new. I thought the story turns out to be something intersting but it is so dissapointing. It really had potential until the end. Like many reviewers already mentioned. I did not care for any character. Most of them are unlikeable and stereotype. I cared most for the two blue villiians and this one with one eye testing the planets for self defense. Sorry we have seen such kind of superhero movies to often."
I knew nothing about this coming into it nor the people involved in making it. It was easy to recognize many of the voices and let's start the off by saying The voice acting was pretty incredible. By the end of the first episode I couldn't believe what I just saw and easily sunk into the rest of it. I knew it was very limited in episodes so I took in just a little bit at a time. And episode here. An episode there. It was better to not take it in all at once. There is a lot to take in! I will end this by saying the show was pretty incredible!
"This TV show is not for children with undeveloped brains because of the gory and blood shed! It is uber rated R to the point it shames the video game ""DOOM"". That should say it all. Ok so some of you might be lost why the father is trying to fix earth? Well this is your common illuminati propaganda cartoon, It explains how a planet reaches a maximum point of too many inhabitants and in this case it explains how humanity will reach 10 billion and will start to decline and become extinct which will render the earth useless and inhabitable for any species. So what is the plan? Kill off all the weak and keep only the strong! Really a crazy notion but the whole 10 billion capacity is not because every scientist around the world has already done the math and there is not enough resources and the Eco system will start to decline once it drops under 70%, So if half the tree's on the earth are chopped there is nothing we can do artificially to save the earth because the earth will start to decline and that is the science of it all. This cartoon was made with that thought in mind how a super civilization figured it out and decided to take matters into there own hands by conquering planets that lack the responsibility to control there population. If they do not Control there population they will just grow out of control and start attacking other planets and steal there resources, hence the episode of the alien race that attacked earth and kept coming back to attack earth because they no longer had anymore resources so they needed to conquer earth. I hope this clarifies a few things in detail so you can understand why the father did what he did, and it is self explanatory why he left, He loves his son more than his mission which is against his creed."
"Story grabbed me from start to finish. Incredible twists and unpredictability! Although some in-depth character development was lacking (hope they get into that in later seasons) and the background story of mark's relationship with his dad (which is the deciding factor in the end) felt a bit rushed at some points. As well as the overwhelming amount of side characters, i am definitely exited for following seasons!P. S would like to see more of titans character... could lead to a rather interesting villan."
This is the type of show that makes you realize what you've been missing. No political or ideological agenda. Just great writing!!
"I thought at first it was a regular superhero cartoon, oh boy was I wrong. I still can't get over the show at all. I hope more seasons come out."
...But this show really got me into it! I gotta be honest Invincible is one of my favourite show right now and it is only season 1! Im not gonna spoil anything or write a novel im just telling go watch this show!
"Invincible caught my attention,so I just had to see and impressively enough it got me through a week with action packed experience relationship dilemma and family misunderstanding,I must say this is a signature purely owned by Amazon they never get tired or bored when it comes to the audience they just keep getting more and more wow so exhilarating.Great work."
"I want to be clear. The animation is creat. But I my opinion there are some parts in the story that are to cliche. It feels like a mix of spiderman, superman and watchmen. But in this series it wasnt working.But in the end the last two episods killed it. The visuals were perfect."
"""Invincible"" is a disappointing addition to the animated superhero genre, marred by poor dialogue, shallow character development, and a lackluster narrative. The dialogue often feels forced and unconvincing, filled with cheesy lines that detract from any semblance of authenticity. Characters are woefully underdeveloped, lacking depth and complexity, leaving viewers struggling to invest in their arcs.The romance subplot falls flat, failing to evoke any genuine emotional connection or investment from the audience. Rather than enhancing the story, it feels tacked on and irrelevant.While attempting not to compare ""Invincible"" to ""The Boys,"" it falls short in its attempts at shock value. The gore, while present, feels gratuitous and ultimately adds little to the overall impact of the show, serving only to pad out its runtime.The reveal of Omni-Man's reasoning behind his actions is disappointingly shallow, lacking the depth and nuance one would expect from such a pivotal moment. Villains are cookie-cutter stereotypes, lacking any real substance or motivation beyond their generic evil intentions.Overall, ""Invincible"" fails to live up to its potential, offering little more than a superficial and forgettable take on the superhero genre."
"It basically works by following a formula of showing tropey animated stuff, then subverting it, usually with extreme violence.Because of this, it keeps you guessing, and it holds you well, with the exception of a few scenes which were more trope than subversion. There are also a few universe inconsistencies which mar it. However, those bits can easily overlooked considering the huge amount they get right.Really a lot of fun. You'll know if its for you after finishing watching the first episode."
"This show really cared about characters that I've never heard about before, and made me want to read a comic I've never heard of. That's how much I enjoyed this show.There's so much to like in this first season. Great, brutal action (since the animation shines with it), great and complex characters, great world-building and nice heart to it all.Now there were things that bugged me, like some characters felt one note and inconsistent (Amber and William)
And the action can be pretty clunky at times, especially during episode 4.However overall, I loved this first season, but I hope the animation improves! (8.9/10)"
"I don't even know where to start...this show is INSANE. I like that the animation is pretty basic but also super detailed when it needs to be and I love how the title gets bloodier each episode. I was not prepared for the amount of guts and gore there was gonna be but (not to sound like a weirdo) I LOVED it lol. I was in total shock after watching the first credits scene, it was just wild. I've never seen a cartoon or even an anime that showed that many bloody organs mushed up or flying around. There's so much more I can get into but to sum it all up this show is incredible and I can't wait for season 2!"
"A great surprise, really these series make me happy and it is one of the best of out there, the series can easily be compared to The Boys but it has the differences that make it unique, highly recommended."
"This is how ""the boys"" was supposed to be (but 2nd season was trash):Heroes who are also people with their own personality, not just ""let's fight for justice ans save the world"" stuff like marvel/dc (that's why iron man is so popular in marvel: is the only one who acts like an idiot while trying to be a hero)I'll just say that after first e[isode, you'll surely want to keep watching the rest (except for ep4, every episode has something to keep you engaged with)Looking forward to see more of this!"
"I loved this series, along with bloody action, it also portraits love angle / triangle and human relations like father son and mother son, very beautifully. A must watch for those who love superhero shows and don't have problem with gory action scenes."
"It's just so god damn good. It's gritty, really gritty. It's deeply emotionally engaging. The humor is laugh out loud funny and appropriately interspersed. I don't even want to spoil some of the general themes. Just watch it.It's the most realistic depiction of what it might be like to have a superman-esque figure living on Earth...s.c.a.r.y, and fascinating.This show gave me reason to go through the annoying process of signing up for imdb after years of using it as a reference.I need season 2 now please."
"I went into this expecting a good amount of gore based on what i'd heard from others, but it was a thousand times more intense than what i expected. I'm normally the type of person who can handle gore just fine, but this was different. The very last fight scene especially was incredibly distrubing and gave me a panic attack from how intense and upsetting it was. The story is interesting and i liked the characters, but i feel the violence didn't need to be as disturbing as it was. Granted, i've not read the comics, so i'm not sure if the subject matter is identical. Perhaps it being animated just made it worse. Either way, i'd say to expect a lot of disturbing imagery before watching this especially if you are triggered by things like it. The ads made the show appear like a typical superhero cartoon, so i'd hate for someone with no prior knowledge of the show to go in not expecting the gore."
"First off this is not for kids, though the material may seem adolescent.This starts out as a coming of age story and then takes a dark twist that includes a lot of gore and blood.From there things settle in and there is not much else in the remaining episodes to write about..."
"Start this off by saying I have read the comics and have been a huge fan of this for years. Watching the season which coves about the first 5 volumes of the comic, this has surpassed all expectations. My biggest positives are to the voice acting. The cast is amazing and their voice work is exceptional. Some actors play the character's age well. The other biggest positive is to the sound design. Each punch is given with the sound of explosiveness and can make you feel like bombs are going off. The animation works well enough for the story. But Be ready for a story that pays homage to comics of the past and finds way to go against most comic book tropes. I love this and so will you."
I haven't read the comics and actually didn't know about Invincible until watching this show and was amazed by it; the most raw dc like superhero animation I've ever watched. Excited about a second season.
"A must watch for any fan of over the top bloody battles. The writing is fantastic as well. I'm generally not a fan of superhero anything but this is one of the greatest exceptions, it's equal parts love letter and deconstruction much like Watchmen."
Not read the comics but saw this recommended on Amazon and thought I'd try it out. It's kinda like the boys but more interesting and has less filler episodes in it. Can't wait for season 2.
"Season 1. The best superhero animated show ever made. By showing us what Nolan can do early in the first few episodes the show becomes a investigation of stakes and dread. We as an audience know that Nolan is a bad guy, but the slow reveal to mark and his mom is amazing. This season is perfectSeason 2. I watched this in one part and I can say this season follows up but fails to meet the insane character that is omniman, instead we get a worse villain and a story of Mark and his relationship. While I like these plot points. Man the end is just annoying. I get that he won't kill. But maybe stop just going straight to him? Like break his hands, or blind him? But he just walks straight into portals? Either way, Mark killing and being distant is a great plot point. But man I need more Nolan!!! 9/10."
"Invincible has become one of the best series or audiovisual content that I have seen in a long time. And it is not because of the animation that although it is good it is still not incredible. Not because of his bloody style, that is very gore in moments. I considered that it is because of the plots and the argument in which the show is being built, that it has become one of the best animated series of the recent times."
"It's been a long time since I've seen a show this good. The story is unlike any animated show, I've been aware of the comic book for years before this came out but I never knew that it was this good. The character development feels rewarding but impossible at the same time, there's a sense of hopelessness at the end because of this.My only ""gripe"" with the show is that some portions have cliche superhero tropes, some superheroes feel like throw-aways. But nevertheless, I find the entire show to fit together quite well and concise.I went into it not expecting much from the soundtrack, but to my surprise I enjoyed every track. Great placement for each scene, Run The Jewels really fits the theme of The Mauler Twins.One of, if not, the greatest season finale ever, leaves you thinking about how it ended and how it could continue on in the future. Highly recommend this to anybody and everybody."
"I love everything about this show except Amber so this is actually a 9.9 rating. Great show though, animation, voice acting, and story are all great."
"Spoilers!Invincible is not a bad watch, but the premise of the series is very shaky imo.For context, I watch series/movies almost entirely for the story. If the story sucked, but the visuals, sound and music were godlike, the series would still suck for me.The series starts off its first episode quite tediously, and I even had a second there after half an hour where I was about to give up on it. However, I bit through and the episode ends with a major opener: Omniman, the most powerful superhero on the planet, and savior of the earth on countless occasions, does something incomprehensibly horrible.Now, I thought, ok, here we go, we're in gear, and I immediately watched the second episode.It turns out however, that I needed to wait until the 8th episode before any of Omniman's actions were explained...and seriously, that explanation fell flat.Omniman is from a planet where everyone is just as powerful as he is, who are conquering the universe (already 1000s of planets conquered), but then as they start to spread themselves too thin, decide to send 1-man missions to weaken singular planets in preparation of invasion...Here's what bugs me:1. The interesting part of the story was Omniman's actions and why he did them. However, it takes apparently the rest of the season to get to that in the last episode.I abhor that kind of storytelling. Stringing along your viewers with the promise of something special only to make it last forever to get there, and then to have the payoff fall flat. (f u ""Lost"")
I keep hoping, that one day in this lifetime, some writer is going to open a series with a bang, just like this, but is going to follow it up with one nuclear blast after another during the rest of the series. (and not drop the ball in the last season, friggin' GoT)2. Seriously? The race of Supermen need to ""weaken"" planets before invasion? Earth can't even handle one of them. They could've sent 2 or 3 Viltrumites and mopped up in 30 minutes flat.3. Omniman's actions, at least in this series (I haven't read the comics its based off), are weird. Why would he kill all of the superheroes in one go? He could've easily sniped every single one of them covertly, IF his aim was not to reveal himself. (Dramatic purposes, I know, so forgivable)
Why doesn't he reveal himself? If I'm to believe him in the last episode, he doesn't give a flying superf* about any human. Why the wait? For his son? But is that really how you would go about it? You have a secret agenda, you're trying to get your son involved in, but you let him out of the loop for his entire life and then just spring it on him: ""Hey, btw, humans are puny insects and I crush them without remorse, wanna join me? For Viltrum! You know that place I've never told you about...""
And then in the end he almost kills his son, but leaves all weepy like...
I get that Omniman might be conflicted, but that is not shown well at all in this series. He's quiet, brooding, denigrates earth's superhumans to himself.He admonishes his son at the start of the series, for making too much collateral damage...but secretly doesn't give a f*...and also doesn't really want his son to give a f*...
He's had an apparently great love relation with his wife, but she's his pet...
He keeps friendly with the tailor who ""knows"" what he did, but doesn't give a damn about the insect earthlings...
So, unless he's a schizophrenic, I don't get that character's mindset. He's all over the place.It's like the plottwists just happen in his brain.I would pick ""The Boys"" over this one any day of the week. The main characters there are really well developped."
"Watched the first episode, liked the concept of it, the personal relationship the main character had with his parents, the great amount of development within just 1 episode, overall great start to the series, but sadly it was all overtaken by the insane amount of gore within just the first episode which ruins all of it. The amount of unnecessary blood and guts, altho be it just cartoon it is over exaggerated where it serves no purpose to the show other than completing someones (writer/producer/director) fantasy. Truly distasteful. You manage to see the vibes this show intends to have compared to ""the boys"" also made by Prime studios, but it is executed in such a nasty way.If it weren't for that, what the viewers would take away from this series would be a nice mystery and action/ adventure series, and would make viewers tune in to watch it completely, but really what people would take away would just be "" that series with overt amount of gore"", which I see driving viewers away."
"Clearly the best show I've seem this year, and I'm not saying that wandavision or fatws were bad that's not what I'm saying at all but invincible takes the superhero genre and takes it where no one has gone it before."
"I hadn't heard of this series before. I regret that. A really successful Superman parody. Just like every good superhero work, we have a superhero who sets the standards in this universe. OMNI-MAN. And the story, just like Injustice, The Boys, and BvS, asks the question of what do we do if this hero turn on to the dark side. Apart from that, I loved every character in the series. One of the main concepts of the work is the element of violence that is not mentioned enough in the superhero world. The work contains very bloody and harsh scenes. Although at some points the authors felt as they fetishized violence, I liked the strikingness of the concept in general. Everyone should watch this masterpiece!"
"This has to be the best animated adaptation of a comic book I have ever seen in my entire life.You get plentiful of blood and violence, hilarious scenes and a story that stays true to the comics original story.I CANNOT wait for the next coming season!"
"The best animated show I have ever seen ,the story keeps you engaged with mystery and twists but takes time to develop characters into people you will surely love. The action is great to watch and some of the bloodiest most intense scenes are gripping , 10/10 for any superhero fan and for non superhero fans characters and voice acting alone will make you love it."
"This tv show really is something else, it's very similar to the boys but the writing feels so immaculate and well calculated with every stone set in place to really shake what we love about superheroes."
"Absolutely brilliant, with blood and guts. True superhero and vilan series. Just don't let Disney buy it and turn it into a kid friendly show."
"I knew going in that this would brutal, but man. That train scene just... broke me. My mouth was open for the rest of the episode after that scene. Some slow moments here and there, particularly towards the middle. But I liked that the main characters felt real. I wanted to punch Mark in his stupid face a couple of times, but that felt like the intention, so I didn't mind too much. Watch this show, unless you can't handle intense violence, in which case DON'T."
"I want more of it, and I want it now, please. This was just brilliant."
This is the best tv shows that I've ever seen. Plot twist in every episode made me want to see more and more. Trust me it's worth to watch.
This is the real heroes !!! Amazing to watch good story and art.
"I am going to leave a good review of this show to spite Kurvos who hates it solely because they took a homophobic character turned gay from the comics and according to him 'made the character a walking stereotype from the 90's'. This show is fantastic, it's definitely one of the best i've seen..i've never read the comics but I would like to."
"One thing abt this serie. I watched it when my mouth was open. Oh, I liked each scene of the animation. Am looking forward to watching more of invicible so don't disappoint me Kirk!!"
"Complete with hokey storylines that should never be revisited. I didn't like how much and for how long the ""girlfriend"" was strung along. And their relationship resolution made no sense. Impressive soundtrack selections. Castlevania has somewhat desensitized me to the level of violence in cartoons but this is off the charts GRUESOME. Should never be live action.The climactic last episode proves that it is totally illogical and ridiculous to indoctrinate your children in 10 minutes. It takes years. Like 18 years! You can make people feel superior even when they are not."
I think social media played a big role in me watching this and finishing the 1st season. Its nice but definitely not a 10 for me. Think this more for the poeple that read the comic which appreciate it mofe.
"You will be bored out of your brains watching this. Obvious, corny and violent for no reason. Give it a miss and enjoy life. Or better still get a compendium of early Marvel classics and read those."
"What can I say except incredible. This masterpiece that emerged from the rubble of Amazon and Netflix originals shines through as a glowing reminder of good tv. While based off of comic books, ""Invincible"" is a tale of betrayal, family, morals and most of all- Superheroes. I highly recommend this show. With its stellar vocal cast not one person shines through as ""the best"". All round a fantastic watch that will leave you emotionally drained by the end."
"I have no words about the series! Amazing action, great character development, mystery that makes you want to watch the next episode to get answers to your questions, art style that reminded me of the old action animated shows i was watching as a kid... I'm not familiar with the source material but I surely will be now! I recommend it to every comic book fan without a doubt! The only reason I'm not giving it a 10/10 is because I want to keep it for the next seasons, which I'm sure will earn it! I can't wait for season 2!"
"I watched this after watching that trash, sorry excuse-for-an-anime Tr*se and it literally saved my June watching experience. I don't watch a lot of shows because I don't have a lot of time on my hands to watch full-length series/films and the like, but investing my time to actually sit down and watch this show was one of the best decisions I've ever made.I've been seeing too many memes from Invincible and I suddenly had the urge to watch this all in one seating. It was delightful (from a viewer's perspective, not Mark's ofc)."
"Mark Grayson always wanted to be like his Dad. But through a process of deep soul searching he discovers the truth. He is a soft coward and is left now not just feeling like a disappointment but knowing he is a disappointment. The truth hits hard, and in this case, it cuts deep as well. Mark's dad is the legendary Omniman. An OG soldier who will make the hard calls when Mark is crying in the corner.Mark seems to be more focused on chasing tail than living up to his father's, already tempered, expectations. Mark, if you're reading this, grow a pair.Legit good show/10."
"The good guys don't always have to win, even if they are ""Invincible"""
"This series is so poorly managed by amazon that I am speechless. Why is Amazon, which pours a lot of money into producing terrible products for famous brands, so reluctant to pour money and resources into this series that people like? The lack of resources and cheapness of the series is so obvious that they included a sequence in which the 4th wall is broken, explaining how they are trying to cover up the inadequate resources in the series. This is the same reason why the second season was divided into two parts and released with such a long interval. If I were the head of Amazon, I would directly fire the managers who squandered it, ignored it, and did not allocate resources after releasing a valuable product."
"After weeks of ignoring tweets on my timeline daily, I gave it a watch. Just took me first some minutes to get hooked and I binge watched all 8 episodes over a night!The writing is awesome, and characters seem naturally motivated and connected.Can't wait for season 2.Oh BTW he isn't really invincible :p."
"But will come back on occasion to rerate. Right now its intriguing and violent, let's see what changes in the next few weeks for me.A Few things
1) Son living up to dad...check
2) Male is kind of a screw up but females are super together...check
3) Not what it seems...check
4) nice looking anime style to save from full frame animation 9i get budgets)...check."
"When I noticed Seth Rogan's involvement, I understood my dismay. He is immature himself and has little concept of being an adult. Terrible actor, even worse producer etc. This cartoon is just another gory kid show. So many flaws and typical kid angst and drama. Animation is mediocre. Story slow and mostly predictable. Seth, being a child himself, seems to have a fixation about regurgitation...pathetic."
"Well, when I said it's like The Boys, it's a compliment. Both Amazon series both follow the same story line, ""if heroes weren't so good?"" both doing such a good job. Follow.The age group of 18 years is justified, for having a lot of violence. A series that does the fight scenes with mastery and, at the same time, has a fluid story that is interesting.The QH history, have a punctual adaptation, as don't take a problem to the history, just help with fluidity."
"I have never seen a Main character get beat up as much as he does in Invincible. Trust me, he gets beaten by EVERYBODY.If you are holding off on this show, don't, it is epic."
So many thoughtful story arcs packed into one story.
And dont believe. If you know you are better get your self together and then do your own progress and get back. The important part is the relationships between you and your surroundings so you have to keep being the leader and providing and giving so the rest can follow you and be invincible.
"I didn't think this would be as good as it was when I started episode one, but the after credits scene cemented the idea that I was going to love it more than most animated shows I've seen. I love the Boys, and I adored this. Most compare the two to each other, which is true, they are very similar, but the two are so vastly different experiences. Invincible was arguably even better than the Boys as well. I'm not going to get too into detail because I just wanted to get this rating on here, but if you haven't seen it, WATCH IT. You won't regret it."
Great tv series animation. I have a full collection of all the comic. And I am so glad they have made this series happen into our TV set.
Brutal and amazing. I guess invincible will become more popular than DC.
Why are all the superhero movies/tv-shows are not like Invincible?
"Fan of the comic, fan of the voice actors, fan of the producers, I like the animation, but I am really bored already. I'm on episode number 4, unless things change probably won't make it to episode 5."
"One of the most overrated shows
If youve seen anything rick and mortyish youve seen this
its basically shock humor with nothing else except...
um
i dont know."
"It's hard to imagine how Season 2 could match or even surpass this season. I mean, the writers certainly left enough unanswered questions to generate loads of material for Season 2 but.... this was a pretty epic, jaw-dropping, high-octane season.The writing is also very clever, which is always refreshing considering that most series these days assume the watcher is brain-dead. This is definitely the type of content that may prompt a re-watch or two.As a side note.... man, J. K. Simmons has one of the most familiar voices I have ever heard.... I guess it's because he's a featured voice actor in literally 90% of the best shows in this genre."
It's an interesting story. Anti hero like the boy. I love it.For a cartoon series that airs on tv is really dark hahaha.
Are you generator Rex ? Thene go and watch this show and trust me I Am totally Sure you will love it .The Two shows are so smiliar but the invincble is More seriose and so bloody .And they both have j.k simmons in Cast so you should watch it .
"Well, when I said it's like The Boys, it's a compliment. Both Amazon series both follow the same story line, ""if heroes weren't so good?"" both doing such a good job.Follow the QH history, have a punctual adaptation, as don't take a problem to the history, just help with fluidity."
"First off I have to say I'm amazing no one talks about how hilariously bad the animation is a times. The face off on Mars looks like a Newgrounds flash animations from 2010.But other than that this show is great. There's been many takes on ""the real struggle to be a superhero"" but this is a very good one. The high school relationship drama isn't great some of the time but the rest is a joy to see unfold. In an amazing twist for a show of this type, it really shows you how actually bad of a hero Invincible is. And even better than that, they present you with a massive mystery from the start. It's not as present as I wish it was in the middle parts of the season, but I the conclusion is a brutal one that keeps you on the edge of your seat (if it wasn't spoiled for you)I look forward to season two."
I don't like anime until i watched Death Note.and invincible action is too awesome. Story is not that much good.
"This show is just amazing. The plot, the cast, everything was just so fantastic. The only caution to others is that the show contains a good amount of gore and violence. Overall amazing show. Can't wait for the upcoming seasons. 10/10 Stars."
Great show and very different to any of the other adult animations/superhero films/shows I've seen.
"The finale was really disappointing as opposed to the season opener that was really great. That's why, in the end, Invincible is just slightly better than a common primetime soap. How Hollywood loves to drag stories along for as long as they can. I mean, it took them eight episodes to allow for Invincible to discover what his father really is. It should have happened by mid-season. Instead, we were distracted with subplots that really led nowhere. Like the whole episode about Titan's deception. Yeah, really disappointing..."
Just saw the first three episodes and everything is so predictable.
"Story, Characters, Animation, everything.... awesome."
"I watched this over the course of a few days and it's insanely good, it follows a more mature version of a Spider-Man-like story. The animation is inconsistent but it's not that noticeable when you're so invested in the everything going on. The story structure and placement of when certain information is revealed makes for a very engaging experience. Not to mention just how great the characters and the world is. The best part of the show is without a doubt the last two episodes, the impact they create on the story really plays with your emotions in a great way. Highly recommend!!!!"
"I didn't expect much while I was watching the first episode, but ohmylord! I can't stop rewatching every single episode that is out üòç"
"The amount of joy this has brought me has been unmatched, I'm really hoping we get more."
"Binged the entire first season in a day, then convinced my family to watch it as well. We all enjoyed it, then happily went out to buy the comic books."
"This was a really good recommendation from one of my friends. At first it has a really basic hero cartoon vibe, but don't you worry, Invincible will give you THE MOMENTS honey. But those moments didn't made up for whole show not being that high quality I guess? Many of the characters felt empty and uninteresting, in contrast I enjoyed many of them too. I love Eve, I think Mark is really cute as a protagonist. This show shows potential and I'm here for it for next seasons. And that train scene? I mean... THAT TRAIN SCENE. U SERIOUS? That whole episode serveddddd."
"I had no idea about the comics until I started watching the series, but I'll be definitely looking into the source material now! Just with the first season there is incredible character development, and the voice acting is absolutely off the charts. Steven Yeun in particular does an amazing job with bringing raw emotion to the role of Mark Grayson, especially in the season finale, which had me sobbing.All in all this is the best animated series I've ever watched, and I am so excited to see what future seasons will bring!"
"Well, when i said it's like The Boys, it's a compliment, both Amazon series, both follow the same story line ""if heroes were not so good?"" Both doing such a good job.The age group of 18 years is justified, for having a lot of violence. A series that does the fight scenes with mastery and, at the same time, has a fluid story that is interesting.The QH history has a punctual adaptation, as don't take a problem to the history, just help with fluidity."
"Interesting show, half way through, and I just can't get over the icon of atom eve having an X through the female symbol. Is this some sort of right wing anti-woman thing?Love the voice of Omni man, that guy's a great actor. Omni man lays on the fatherly superhero role very thick at times, which seems apt.Pretty good plot lines concerning super heroes and their day jobs with relationships.Just got to the part where the robot leader turns into the bad guy. AI being bad, coupled with the misogynistic undertones, really screams right wing political nonsense.Will I keep watching? Yeah, but I'll always prefer shows that teach our kids how to be better to each other, reinforcing that we should think before we act."
"Wow. I've seen my fair share of superhero movies and tv shows, so initially, I was excited for an animated series that was so highly rated with a top cast. But everything about this was dull. The animation was super cheap, like, worse than scooby doo. And the story....don't believe the reviews claiming this has great story arcs- it doesn't. Everything was super predictable with little to no payoff. Who wrote this? The characters all felt like knockoffs of other characters from other shows, and none of them were actually likable. I should have stopped watching after the first episode but I got misled by all the glowing reviews and thought this would actually go somewhere or there would be a big twist. The answer is no on both accounts."
I didn't know much about invincible before this series and just wanted to see how it was. This show is amazing and has a very engaging story. It balances the comedy action and the insane storyline well with their 40 min episodes. If you like the boys on amazon this show will interest you as well.
Absolutely perfect in both story and animation! Brilliant stuff and keep em coming please!
"Not a comic book fan, anime expert or anything else, but I loved this series! Well placed, good characters, just.... GREAT!"
"Just finished the entire 1st season, and I was on my seat from the beginning to the end. A real roller coaster of emotions. It is extremely good with and all Star voice casting. I love the graphic superhero violence. Finale even had me crying."
Incredibly written? For sureExtremely fresh? DefinitelyAddicting? Very muchOne of the best superhero productions ever made: In...*TITLE CARD*
"I knew nothing of the comic going in but damn, this is a fun ride. I love this show. It has everything."
"The incredible animation and decree writing on this show put this one in the masterpieces of TV Animation and Comic Book adaption in general. With compelling characters, incredible plot and hints of symbolism and existentialism make this show an amazing watch that will keep you guessing and interested throughout!"
"Seems that to get a good rating, cartoons need to be full of blood, like, above the storyline, it's ok to show brains all over."
"The premise, the animation and the pacing is impeccable. The gore is unforgiving. There are parallels to dragon ball series but the narration is top notch. Amazon has found gold with this and The Boys."

"There is a lot to love about this show. The acting is great, I love the way the plot is presented and how you're never quite sure what everyone's motivations are and what's going to happen. The way the season wraps up is phenomenal. Its only drawback is that the animation could be a little smoother and a little more detailed. But the storyboarding and the choreography more than make up for it."
"The Invincible TV show is a near-perfect cartoon series for the comic, only tweaking certain plot elements to make the story progression feel more deserved by the finale of the season. Great show.Only questionable decision was to blackwash Amber (who was white throughout the run of the comics). If they wanted to bring a character of color more to the forefront of the story, they could have very easily spent more time on Titan or Black Samson in the first season. Changing the color of a love interest that won't even be a main character a few seasons from now doesn't really do a whole lot."
"Tell people about the shows you like. Make recommendations. Had I not been told of this show I would not have discovered the amazing cast, beautiful artwork, brutality and every other excellent aspect of this animated series.I was hooked from the first episode and am currently tearing through this show.I am excited to see what is to come.I am,however, still bummed over the brutal massacre of the original Guardians of the Globe (mostly because of the awesome talent no longer with the show)."
"Was not familiar with the source material but the end of episode 1 was a super-wtf-I'm-officially-hooked scene. Loved the fight scenes and the plot. Voice acting was just ok. Or maybe I'm too used to anime voice acting, it didn't really feel like it has that kinda passion to it. But oh well the plot alone is good enough to keep me hooked."
"I literally fast forward thru all the dialogue. Am I like this every series? No. Am I this way for a cartoon series that takes itself waaaay to serious? Yes. Between all the interconnecting relationships that I do not care anything about, to the emotional feelings of the hero, I cannot listen to all that every week. If the episodes were a little shorter and the drama was a little shorter, it would be more palatable.The action is good though. I do not know why invincible has to get beat to a pulp every episode, but meh. I fast forward to the good parts and watch the fight scenes. I am a grown 40 year old man by the way, and have no problem with dialogue and plot. But I like my cartoon entertainment a little less mature."
"Just watched a few episodes but is it fine to use the design of characters from other comics to suit your own ideas? Not sure about the comic, but in the TV series, I saw copies of Batman, Thor(as a woman), Flash, Kree, Skrull, Hellboy, Scarlet Witch and even One-Punch Man in first few episodes.Maybe it is better to write an anti-hero story with your own-design characters rather than twist and superficialize existing superhero designs from other movie/comic products?"
"Invincible looks like a mediocre attempt to metamorphose a classic animated superhero series into a shonen anime on the fly.Pros: sleek level of graphic violence, remarkable voice acting, few decent characters (especially for western animation), and some good humor.Cons: destitute worldbuilding; lack of logic; awful graphics and cheap animation in much of the show + ill-chosen, eclectic, and quite often changing art style; and clumsy modern values dialogues.S01 - 5/10: The 1st season of Invincible is a rickety yet entertaining show whose quality constantly fluctuates between 3 and 7. Invincible has the potential to shine and close all the gaps in the story, but currently - it's a mess."
"I get why it is so impressive and innovative for some, but not for me. The ideas, superheroes were copied and that was a big minus for me. One thing got me hooked and that is the ""why"" from the ending and only for that I will watch the second season. I'm happy for the Amazon success, but not like this. Make more, but better! Peace & Love!"
"Just because animation can get around some censorship issues regarding violence doesn't mean you should fill your show with multiple, vile acts of brutality, on a level that borders on psychotic. I'm not against depictions of violence on film or TV, but within reason and with moderation; as in is it necessary to the plot. This just appears to be a gorefest to score ratings, simply lazy writing; baffled how this got a green light to be produced or how it attracted the voice talent that it did.Hollywood needs to stop pandering to the teenage market, because the quality of film and TV being produced today is a catalogue of dire drek!"
The show itself is phenomenal but it's really sabotaging themselves by splitting a season. Season one was unparalleled one of the best shows I've followed in a long time. Season two they decided to take a seasonal break to give folks time to enjoy the holidays and in reality it might be the worst choice they could make to the series. Millions of people have time off these couple months and instead of getting to build off of momentum they are gonna torpedo this second season into the ground. Started off very very strong triple the amount of viewers and I'm betting after the hiatus they've taken for the release of the episodes I bet it tanks back to where it was season one. I hope this can survive one of what seems to be the worst executive decisions of the century and gets season three but I am ready to see the show buried on how it's been released.
"Pretty good, but too drawn out. 30 minute episodes, or rather a two hour movie, would have been much better. Now we got too much filler and endless action scenes which did little to propel the story forward. I want to rate this a 6, but I subtract two stars because I can't stand one trick pony Jason Mantzoukas who does the same old annoying schtick in everything he does, and he was in this show way too much."
"Brilliant comics and mediocre adaptions.Mostly because of pretty bad picture. It is cheaply drawn, and it made by clearly lazy artists. Speed ahead of quality. Lack of minor details.And can't understand why no Savage Dragon, why Sceance Dog instead Science Dog? Although they have all rights to them. I start to afraid that they will skip spider-man too.And what the hell with boring mummy? Please return bomb-people!"
"I tried to watch this show, but was quickly deterred by the shoddy visual style, awful voice acting, and horrendous dialogue. It really seems like nobody involved with this project was even trying."
"I have watched all of season 1. Join Marc as he gains his powers and grows in the shadow of his father trying to fill the gap left when the guardians of the globe die mysteriously. The show is a cross between the boys and one punch man. Obviously the world is based heavily on the DC universe amounting to a parody. They have the problem of the high school setting trying to appeal to the teenagers, love triangles and such, bringing down the plot of most episodes. Good fights but doesn't beat one punch man or other such anime. Good hook to start with but the main character isn't that interesting to follow throughout."
"This show has a great voice cast, but as usual in american animation, the stiffness of it and the expressionless characters make it a wasted effort from the actors. It just looks bad.Besides that, the show has great elements, but for me, the problem from above makes it hard to watch. I'll stick with anime."
"One of the most overrated show in recent times. While first season was kinda okay, second season is bland and generic with underdeveloped ""monster of the week"" formula. They took everything that used to be fun or entertaining in the super hero genre and decided to focus on the boring characters serving it with a healthy smattering of gore - just for shock value. Stakes are rendered low by the fact that the writer cooks up weak one liners to rescue ""killed"" or fatally injured characters. Satire when written well can provide some of the best kind of entertainment. The superhero genre offers so many tropes that can be satirized. This is not one of those shows. It is a pale weak imitation of better MCU / DCEU shows, with a pathetic attempt at subversion. It had one good idea - the main villain in season 1. The rest is a meandering mess of suited up characters about whom you have very little reason to care. This is a ""tell"" don't know how to ""show"" show.Don't waste your time on this."
"Because he gets slapped around in almost every episode. Seriously, whenever a big bad appears you know the episode is going to end the same way - with Invincible laying bloody in a crater, and the bad guy standing over him and telling him how worthless he is. The next episode is usually him sulking around, questioning whether he even wants to be Invincible, then BOOM... He ends up in another crater. Rinse and repeat.I also find it interesting how the plot I actually want to see, which is Omni-Man's redemption and the fight against his people, takes a backseat to an endless barrage of worthless villans.Fun show, great voice acting, but is it too much to ask to have Invincible save the day and not cry about it? One time?"
"The show is ok - entertaining enough for extreme animated violence.The volume is ridiculous - gotta basically either have it nearly muted with subtitles to understand the parts with dialogue and have the action at a tolerable level, otherwise if the vocalization is loud enough to hear then the action scenes will probably blow the speakers or slowly disintegrate the sheetrock behind the TV."
"A very enjoyable series with a lot of potential, with more seasons to come."
"Its a good show but i onry really liked the mystery about omni man and his interactions as well as the subplot with titan and mark. Dont like amber and the comedic relief. The mom and eve are ok. Ep 6 was the worst. The blue guys were fun, the new guardians were guite flat and i dont like rex."
The show is just another sad attempt to get viewers by shocking them with pointless violence. It just shows a lack of creativity or originality. Waste of time.
"I struggle to fathom the reasons why so many people apparently think this is a good TV show. This genre is soooooooo tired. It's been run through, quite successfully at times, for the last 25 years and, similar to Amazon's other flagship superhero show 'The Boys', this offers absolutely nothing new to anything that has come before it. It's just the same stuff over and over again, played out with a slightly different angle, a bit more violence and blood and, in this case, with bigger names doing the voiceovers.If you're very young and you're catching up on the genre, 'Invincible' might seem somewhat unique and / or original to you. But if you've seen it all over the last couple of decades or so, and you still think this is a good show, man you need to broaden your horizons a bit."
"Based on a comic. Another Super hero show.POSITIVES: Action, good pace. If they stuck to the source material, this show would have been epic.NEGATIVES: A lot of blood and gore - it didn't bother me but it could turn some people off. Also, there is the typical P. C. preaching, race swapping, etc. - par for the course, but it's distracting and patronizing.In my opinion, ""Dare Devil"" or ""Punisher"" is a much better option."
"I actually really like Invincible overall, I just think there's a bit too much gore lol."
"I tell you what...I watched the whole series...hanging on hoping that the teens in this series would be redeemed...because they are likable and redeemable. Unfortunately, the adults in this series are not. Redeeming is not the agenda here. This show to me is all about programming our minds to anticipate a coming Dystopia...and that all sorts of human and property collateral damage are justified in the ongoing wars our so-called political leaders (actually psychopathic criminal puppets) tell us we have to fight. The graphics were amazing. The acting was top notch. The story was abysmal. And the human gore and murderous destruction...was simply disgusting. I can't unwatch this, and I won't watch any sequel, as it will be predictably worse."
"Let's address that the Invincible comics and storyline have been around since the early 2000's, so it did this ""if Superman were bad"" storyline before it got popular. That being said, this show should have been made ten to twelve years ago. Visually the show is stunning and they have an incredible voice cast. A couple of the episodes did that lazy show thing where a show will have subpar episodes but then at the tail end of the episode something big will happen because they're banking on your curiosity forcing you to watch more. I kept it at five stars because of how well it's made, I would have liked this if I hadn't seen so many movies and shows with this same theme."
"This Amazon Prime Original series delivers on all accounts! The pacing is aggressively mobile but steady enough to build context. The fight scenes are delivered with spectacular execution full of vigor and surprise. You're immediately drawn in. In short, this is another twist of the superhero motif so popular these days. Yet despite its maximum effort, Invincible remains a solid 'C' - if only for its lack of originality. It borrows heavily from a string of other commercially profitable comic book franchises easily identifiable. It's basically 'The Justice League' meets... (don't wanna spoil it). Anyway, you'll immediately recognize which characters were spoofed as they begin to crop up throughout the story. But that's OK because it's all so entertaining to watch. Most of the essential ingredients for a great story are present!!! Luckily, the first episode is followed up by an additional two. This science fiction superhero fantasy is going to be a whole lot of interesting, I'm guessing. Let's see where it goes."
"If you like Robert Kirkman-style, you will like this. Overwise. It the same basic concept seen before. Robert Kirkman have one-idea and one-idea only. It just another example of the lack of creativity. My opinion is that Robert Kirkman is terrible. He cannot write a good story. He just using other ideas and doing the same thing."
"Got through 15 minutes and didn't want to watch any more.... it didn't suck me in and It was incredibly hard to watch, physically - maybe cartoon style movies just aren't for me."
"You take a cup(y) of Watchmen. Add to that 2 cup(ies) of The Boys and stir. Finally season with the imagination of One punch Man.Or just buy Warren Ellis Stormwatch run from Image Comics.Don't really know who this series is for really. People seem to like it but then again ""people"" can do or think the dumbest things. Anyways, nothing new, just rehashed plot elements from comics we knowxand love.A ""C"" for at least having good taste in comics. And this is the guy who created The Walking Dead. Damn!"
I'm sorry the story was a basic son growing up to be like his dad and it was so boring. However it took a DARK turn that got so gruesome my partner and I had to leave the room. We can handle blood but when it's super gratuitous and unessecary it's just awful. Even for an animated show.
"Each episode is over 40 minutes long, way too much for a show like this and it's so severe that, due to my short attention span, I just cannot sit through and watch through an entire episode in one sitting.Maybe if this was at a normal length for a show like this (which is typically 20 minutes, 25 at most), I would come to enjoy this. But at this point, I can't."
"Seriously, we get it. Men are dumb, women are way more intelligent, teenage boys are idiots while their female counterparts are smart and sassy in comparison to their idiotic ways.It would be great if modern writers could change the record as it's been going on since the Simpsons and on numerous tv shows as well. How about 'not all men/teenage boys are gormless/clueless and not all females are smart/ sassy and superior.'
Once you notice this as a trope it's impossible to ignore. Unless you enjoy that of course..."
"I don't have much to say about this show! I actually really like the fights and the gore, but the plot of the show is very meh!!! It has such an interesting setup on the first episode when omni man kills the league, it makes you really wonder what were his reasons, turns out he didn't have reasons, he is just basically the bad guy!Also, it's out of nowhere that he is just so evil! In all the episodes he seems to care at least a little at what is going on around him but at the last episode because they really need to convince us that he is evil he just kills random people for no reason.My last point about this show that I found weird is that the characters react very strange to things that happen! Like omni mans wife, she knows that he is the most powerful superhero and that he ""defeats"" bad guys all day (basically kills bad guys) she knows what he does, and when she finds out that he killed the league she was just sure that he was the one who was evil, not the league plotting something or that Cecil might be evil. I found that kinda odd. Ahh this show over all is just a hot mess!"
"I guess everyone wants to imitate GOT these days. As a result the art of animation and storytelling takes a secondary role.I wish it didn't have the unnecessary cussing and gory violence so that I could watch it with my kids.This show will likely appeal to teenagers with limited life experience, but seasoned adults will hardly be amused."
"I'd be looking forward to this for ages, I love this style of animation and humour, Harley Quinn for me was so much fun, I expected a little less language that that show though. Found myself 4 episodes in, I just didn't get it, I didn't like any of the super heroes just thought it felt lazy, I think I missed the point why they were rip offs of other heroes but to me it wasn't funny, the script was atrocious and it was way too slow, pacing is key especially with humour but unimportant moments were dragging. I think it maybe helps if your somewhat familiar with the comic but it should be. It turned from must see to background tv quickly."
"Ok I loved the 1st season then we have 1 episode for the whole of the 2nd season and it's the back story of Eve Atom, why is this the 2nd season surely that is a stand alone episode in the 1st season.Or maybe the writers got way too high and forgot what episodes goes where...Ok then we come to the 3rd season.So the first 4 episodes came out in November and the second part of the season doesn't come out until January, have they been spending to much time with Seth and Evan smoking...Got so excited for the new season just be disappointed and now I have to wait until January, I know this was some waste of space exec at Amazon who made this call and oh how I wish I could meet them in person..."
The story is very good and so are the characters but the regular blood splattering scenes are completely unnecessary. Why can't it be made without the extreme gore? If you can put up with that you will probably enjoy the series.
"The biggest rip off ive seen. The characters are completely rip offs from DC Universe with no original ideas apart from the story maybe. Its stupid. But still a good watch, i can't deny that."
"So far nothing interesting really, it's mostly filler until the few mildly interesting parts arrive. Western people aren't good at anime sorry, never have been."
Superhero cartoon for adults with a lot of violence.
Watched one episode and came out traumatized. If you can't handle horribly gory and graphically gory might I add. Don't watch it. It's good though. But chance of trauma is there.
"Enjoyed the series, but the one-eyed cyborg fighters at the end looked an awful lot like the mannequin soldiers created by. Amestris, using the incomplete . The character of D. A. Sinclair looked a lot like Solf J. Kimblee, too."
"Weird to see here the comparisons, I don't understand. It's different, it's a very cool mix between past and future! Honestly really enjoy the story telling on this. Really hope more seasons to come."
"For now I give it an 8, which for me is unusually high for tv animation, but this one might actually reach my top ratings of 9 or 10 if they manage to really see this through to the insanely epic future stories of the comic.So far so good."
